00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:12.026
Fuck!

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:28.976
Okay, I've got ten numbers,
four spots.

00:01:28.978 --> 00:01:30.645
I need a four-digit code.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.049
No, no, no.

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:36.486
Shit! What now?

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:42.993
Shit.

00:01:43.993 --> 00:01:45.793
Jesus Christ.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:47.895
Clues.

00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:49.566
Shit. Okay.

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.736
That's nothing.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.104
"Follow the light
to greener pastures."

00:01:57.106 --> 00:02:00.341
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:01.778
Light? What light?

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:08.650
Light. Follow the light.

00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:10.852
Green. Green book, yeah.

00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:13.223
Greener pastures.
Okay. Yeah, all right.

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:29.405
Oh!

00:02:30.973 --> 00:02:33.708
"At any point in history,
to watch another die,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.745
unveils time's great mystery,
while leaving you alive."

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:39.245
Time. Time.
Some kind of clock.

00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:40.283
Shit.

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:42.850
Where's the clock?

00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:44.221
I don't see a goddamn clock!

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.427
"To watch another person die."
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:56.464
"To watch another person die."

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.899
Oh, shit!

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:03.171
Okay.
They're pointing! Let's see.

00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:06.073
It's time.
It's hands on a clock. Yeah.

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:08.743
That one's four! Four o'clock!

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:10.043
Eight.

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:11.644
Six!

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.016
Two! That's the number,
that's the code!

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:19.419
Okay. Where's the four?
Shit. Come on.

00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.290
All right. Okay. Yeah, good.

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.628
Come on, come on! Eight!

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:27.262
Six.

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:30.832
Oh, my God.

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:33.667
Where's the...?
Six, six, six!

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.837
Oh, God!

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.840
Two, two! Yeah. Okay. Come on.

00:03:39.842 --> 00:03:41.011
Come on.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.447
Come on! Why isn't it working?

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.781
Oh, shit.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.955
Come on.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:56.592
Open! Come on, open!

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:03.663
Oh, God, there's no way out!

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:12.773
Please get me out!

00:04:12.775 --> 00:04:14.642
Shit! No!

00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:16.342
No!

00:04:55.218 --> 00:04:57.351
Has anyone
ever heard the saying,

00:04:57.353 --> 00:04:59.019
"A watched pot never boils"?

00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:02.289
Well, on a quantum scale,
that may actually be true.

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.294
Does anyone know
what the quantum Zeno effect is?

00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:09.262
Wow, guys, not all at once now.

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:19.774
Well, it may well be

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:22.776
one of the oddest things
in quantum physics.

00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:27.413
Simply put,
observation stops movement.

00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:29.584
Atoms won't change
while you watch them.

00:05:32.654 --> 00:05:34.589
All right,
that's all the time we have.

00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:36.824
Have a good holiday.
See you after the break.

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:38.993
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:05:41.964 --> 00:05:44.964
Zoey, can I talk to you
for a minute?

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.767
I read your paper
on the quantum Zeno effect.

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:49.437
So, you want to be heard.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.072
You want to share
what you know,

00:05:51.074 --> 00:05:53.310
but only in the safety
of your own dorm room?

00:05:54.444 --> 00:05:57.243
I'll try and speak up more.

00:05:57.245 --> 00:05:59.846
It might seem like reducing
the number of variables

00:05:59.848 --> 00:06:01.781
in your life will control
the outcome,

00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:04.319
but life isn't
a science experiment.

00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:06.820
You can't contain
your world forever.

00:06:06.822 --> 00:06:09.022
Try doing one thing
that scares you

00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:10.690
over break, okay?

00:06:10.692 --> 00:06:12.161
Okay.

00:06:23.572 --> 00:06:25.272
Ray, it's Jason. Listen.

00:06:25.274 --> 00:06:27.675
You want to buy a boat
by retirement, right?

00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:29.877
Well, keep focusing
on these low-beta stocks,

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.279
and it's going to be a rowboat
with rented oars.

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:33.848
By the end
of the first quarter,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.515
the market's going to see
a 10-percent return,

00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:37.720
while you'll be
sailing away with 30.

00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.055
Uh-huh.

00:06:41.057 --> 00:06:43.757
Hey, you won't regret it.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.260
I must be like the Mr. Miyagi
of trading to you, Charlie.

00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:48.695
"Mr...?"

00:06:48.697 --> 00:06:50.163
Jesus Christ, kid,
what year were you born?

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:51.764
He's this wise,
old Japanese man

00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:54.834
who taught a kid karate
so he could beat up other kids.

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:56.469
Mr. Ackerman for you
on line one.

00:06:56.471 --> 00:06:58.207
100 bucks says
I'm getting a gift.

00:06:59.908 --> 00:07:03.678
Congratulations, Mr. Ackerman.
Are you celebrating?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.147
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ackerman.

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:09.519
No. No, no, no,
I couldn't accept a gift.

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:12.252
Uh-huh.

00:07:12.254 --> 00:07:14.721
A private jet. To Tahiti?

00:07:14.723 --> 00:07:16.791
Wow.

00:07:16.793 --> 00:07:18.993
Your home there. Uh-huh.

00:07:18.995 --> 00:07:20.362
Heh.

00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.498
Now, that sounds
like a hell of a weekend.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.135
Man who catch fly
with chopstick...

00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:31.072
accomplish anything.

00:07:31.074 --> 00:07:33.143
You, beginner luck.

00:07:37.413 --> 00:07:39.947
Wax on, wax off.

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:42.416
Hey, Gary.
I, uh...

00:07:42.418 --> 00:07:45.118
I heard there was...

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.555
an opening up front
at checkout.

00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:51.524
I could use the bump.

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:53.493
I'm trying to move out
of my mom's.

00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:55.596
It's starting to cramp
her style.

00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:57.531
Look, I feel for you, kid.

00:07:57.533 --> 00:07:59.603
I really do.
You know, I do.

00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:04.774
It's just putting you out front
would be bad for business.

00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:09.612
Yeah.

00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:13.747
Yeah, I'm not cut out for

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:16.286
customer service
shit anyhow, so...

00:08:19.254 --> 00:08:20.624
Ben...

00:08:22.358 --> 00:08:24.961
you've got to find
healthier ways to unwind.

00:08:26.596 --> 00:08:29.098
Go outside, make a friend.

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.568
- I didn't mean to...
- It's fine, it's fine. Sorry.

00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:38.141
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:47.949
A messenger dropped this off
for you.

00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:49.449
It's from Mr. Ackerman.

00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:50.950
Of course it is.

00:08:50.952 --> 00:08:52.454
This better be keys
to a Tesla.

00:08:59.794 --> 00:09:02.231
"For always thinking
outside the box."

00:09:05.634 --> 00:09:07.901
Well, it seems like
Mr. Ackerman has graduated

00:09:07.903 --> 00:09:11.975
from sending single malts
to boxes that don't open.

00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:16.443
Yeah. Rich people are weird.

00:09:16.445 --> 00:09:18.411
Money can't buy you
happiness.

00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:21.015
You better afford your own brand
of misery, Charlie.

00:09:21.017 --> 00:09:24.951
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Whatever. I'll be in tomorrow.

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:31.190
♪ They say sleep
Is the cousin of death ♪

00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:33.526
Hey, offer still stands.

00:09:33.528 --> 00:09:34.962
Are you sure
you don't want to come

00:09:34.964 --> 00:09:36.329
to my family's
for Thanksgiving?

00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:38.031
Thank you, but, you know,

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:40.133
big family dinners
aren't really my thing.

00:09:40.135 --> 00:09:41.669
Okay.

00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:48.309
You know, I'm really psyched
about having time to myself.

00:09:48.311 --> 00:09:50.009
I've been wanting
to take a stab

00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:53.314
at one of those cuboid
conjectures for, like, forever.

00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:55.081
It's really cool, actually.

00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:56.651
They claim irreducibility

00:09:56.653 --> 00:09:58.719
of three univariate
polynomials

00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:01.689
with integer coefficients
and if that is true,

00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:05.858
then Euler's concept
of a perfect box can't exist.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.596
Wow.

00:10:11.533 --> 00:10:15.703
You know, sometimes I wonder
if you just make up words

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:18.137
because you know
I won't Google them.

00:10:40.428 --> 00:10:42.262
Not again.

00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:00.314
Are you okay?

00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:01.915
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:04.821
Well, I'm out of here.

00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:07.289
Okay.

00:11:21.937 --> 00:11:24.604
Hey, this is for you.

00:11:24.606 --> 00:11:28.241
It's from your professor.

00:11:28.243 --> 00:11:30.444
- Oh.
- Wait.

00:11:30.446 --> 00:11:32.445
You guys aren't doing it,
are you?

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:35.715
What? No.

00:11:35.717 --> 00:11:38.752
Well, have fun
playing with your...

00:11:38.754 --> 00:11:39.855
box.

00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:43.293
Bye, Allison.

00:11:45.126 --> 00:11:46.328
Bye.

00:11:53.336 --> 00:11:55.038
"Open new doors."

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.870
"A chance to escape."

00:13:03.672 --> 00:13:06.406
Remember,
the puzzle box is intuitive.

00:13:06.408 --> 00:13:07.976
You don't want to force it.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.592
Snap, crackle, and...

00:13:26.195 --> 00:13:27.195
Heh.

00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:33.334
I hate you.

00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:39.738
Give this to the guy
that failed eighth grade math.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.443
Great idea, Gary.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.081
This is the biggest waste of...

00:13:51.485 --> 00:13:55.789
"This serves as an entry voucher
for Minos Escape Rooms."

00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:58.425
"Be the first to escape
our most immersive rooms yet

00:13:58.427 --> 00:14:01.060

00:14:01.062 --> 00:14:04.167
"RSVP at
minosescaperooms.com."

00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:32.959
Hi.

00:14:32.961 --> 00:14:35.594
This is the Minos building?

00:14:35.596 --> 00:14:37.667
- I think so.
- Thanks.

00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.341
Yeah, it's going to kill me,
I know.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.876
Hi.

00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:51.611
Yeah. I'm here
for the escape room.

00:14:51.613 --> 00:14:52.648
ID please.

00:14:59.054 --> 00:15:00.054
Thanks.

00:15:06.495 --> 00:15:09.463
- Most guys buy me dinner first.
- I need to collect your phone.

00:15:09.465 --> 00:15:10.863
Really? Why?

00:15:10.865 --> 00:15:12.498
You can't be Twittering pictures
of the puzzles.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.536
- Okay.
- Third floor.

00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:17.039
Okay, thanks.

00:15:18.173 --> 00:15:20.175
Thank you for your service.

00:15:27.817 --> 00:15:29.217
Hold the door, please.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.493
I always sneak in
a second one.

00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:42.565
- The waiting rooms can get so boring.
- Mm.

00:15:52.606 --> 00:15:54.076
Yes!

00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:11.458
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.959
Okay, thanks.

00:16:12.961 --> 00:16:14.927
Quite the welcome
wagon, isn't she?

00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:16.696
Super friendly. Heh.

00:16:16.698 --> 00:16:19.233
- Hey, Michael. Mike.
- Amanda.

00:16:19.235 --> 00:16:21.368
- Your name's Amanda?
- Yeah.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.868
- Isn't that funny?
- What?

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.004
I had a family dog growing up
named Amanda.

00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:26.906
She was a cute,
little husky-collie.

00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:28.175
Two different colored eyes,
actually.

00:16:28.177 --> 00:16:29.175
It was very unique. Yeah.

00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:30.576
Cool.

00:16:30.578 --> 00:16:34.046
Yeah, she was cool.
Yeah, and then she died.

00:16:34.048 --> 00:16:36.016
You know, dogs die.

00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:46.725
Hitchhiking accident.

00:16:46.727 --> 00:16:48.528
Can you still play
video games?

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.131
No. No, man.
Unfortunately I can't,

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:54.634
so I just have sex with
adult women to fill the time.

00:16:54.636 --> 00:16:57.706
- Heh. Okay.
- Yeah.

00:17:02.844 --> 00:17:04.511
Uh...

00:17:04.513 --> 00:17:05.946
Sorry. Hi.

00:17:05.948 --> 00:17:08.315
- Hi.
- Do I know you?

00:17:08.317 --> 00:17:10.816
No, I don't think so.

00:17:10.818 --> 00:17:13.586
Really? You look
really familiar to me.

00:17:13.588 --> 00:17:15.991
You're not on TV
or something, are you?

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.497
Well, this is going to suck.
Hi.

00:17:23.499 --> 00:17:25.201
Hey.

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.003
Sign-in sheet?

00:17:30.005 --> 00:17:31.904
Yeah, don't bother.
She's preoccupied.

00:17:31.906 --> 00:17:33.009
How are you doing?
Mike.

00:17:34.442 --> 00:17:35.676
- Ben.
- Ben.

00:17:35.678 --> 00:17:37.509
I'm guessing you got
a box too, huh?

00:17:37.511 --> 00:17:39.078
Yeah.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.914
Did it take
you long to open it?

00:17:40.916 --> 00:17:43.017
It didn't take me too long.

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:44.852
Yeah, we all got boxes.

00:17:44.854 --> 00:17:46.556
Opening it was the easy part.

00:17:48.757 --> 00:17:51.190
So, the website for
this place made the games

00:17:51.192 --> 00:17:52.859
look pretty fun, huh?

00:17:52.861 --> 00:17:55.528
Yeah. They're basically
like real-life video games.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.064
- Really?
- So, you've done

00:17:57.066 --> 00:17:58.565
one of these before.

00:17:58.567 --> 00:18:01.367
I've done 93 rooms.
Yeah, all the big ones.

00:18:01.369 --> 00:18:04.136
Panic Room, Enigma,
Basement...

00:18:04.138 --> 00:18:08.174
Breakout, Break In, Lock In.
Lock Down, of course.

00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:11.245
I've done all the bunkers:
World War One, World War Two...

00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:13.747
Cold War,
Cold War Two: Pol Pot's Revenge.

00:18:13.749 --> 00:18:15.681
Uh...

00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:17.249
What about you guys?

00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:18.985
You must be really good
at these, huh?

00:18:18.987 --> 00:18:20.420
Yeah. I'm pretty good.

00:18:20.422 --> 00:18:22.021
It's not cool.

00:18:22.023 --> 00:18:23.856
Yeah. You know,
my nephew's like you.

00:18:23.858 --> 00:18:25.359
He's completely obsessed.
He burns through

00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:27.494
all of his allowance money
on escape rooms.

00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:28.995
He's the reason why I'm here.
He signed me up.

00:18:28.997 --> 00:18:31.131
And apparently this room
was rated

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:33.299
one of the top in the country
on some chat room.

00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:34.867
Yeah.

00:18:34.869 --> 00:18:36.736
My weirdo rich client
gave this to me as a gift.

00:18:36.738 --> 00:18:38.171
It felt mandatory.

00:18:38.173 --> 00:18:40.140
Yeah, paying people
to lock me in a room

00:18:40.142 --> 00:18:42.142
never seemed
too appealing to me.

00:18:42.144 --> 00:18:43.977
Yeah? What changed your mind?

00:18:43.979 --> 00:18:47.847
- Ha, ha. Uh...$10,000.
- Yeah, me too.

00:18:47.849 --> 00:18:50.350
That is a big chunk of change
in my book, you know?

00:18:50.352 --> 00:18:52.184
Yeah. I've been driving
an 18-wheeler

00:18:52.186 --> 00:18:54.020
since I had this injury
a while back,

00:18:54.022 --> 00:18:57.056
and I've been reading
about these self-driving cars.

00:18:57.058 --> 00:18:59.593
And I heard that
the trucking industry's

00:18:59.595 --> 00:19:01.059
going to be the first one to get
automated,

00:19:01.061 --> 00:19:03.296
so I'm trying to just squirrel
away a few nuts

00:19:03.298 --> 00:19:05.230
before the robots
come to get me.

00:19:05.232 --> 00:19:07.767
- That was a real buzzkill, man.
- It's just my life.

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:09.736
This one's got
to be really insane

00:19:09.738 --> 00:19:11.470
for there to be a cash prize.
The website said

00:19:11.472 --> 00:19:12.971
no one's been able
to escape it yet.

00:19:12.973 --> 00:19:14.775
If we're able to do that,
we're going to have

00:19:14.777 --> 00:19:16.276
so much street cred.
You have no idea.

00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:18.312
Are there rules and regulations?
What?

00:19:18.314 --> 00:19:20.581
You just have to escape
before the clock runs out.

00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:22.148
Well,
what happens if you don't?

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.616
Some guy comes in
through the door

00:19:23.618 --> 00:19:25.218
and explains all the clues
you missed.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.453
He makes you feel
like a total idiot.

00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:28.787
When does the game start?

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:30.524
We are waiting
for the Games Master

00:19:30.526 --> 00:19:32.124
to come in to give us
the story

00:19:32.126 --> 00:19:33.927
and take us to the escape room.

00:19:33.929 --> 00:19:35.728
Like, it's a zombie apocalypse
and we have to find

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.264
the cure
before we get eaten alive.

00:19:37.266 --> 00:19:38.797
I like that one.
That one sounds good.

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.701
While the Games Master is
looking for a parking spot,

00:19:41.703 --> 00:19:43.772
I'm going to go smoke
a cigarette.

00:19:52.146 --> 00:19:53.146
Oh.

00:19:55.784 --> 00:19:57.453
Shit. Um...

00:20:00.188 --> 00:20:01.857
Hey, the doorknob came off.

00:20:03.325 --> 00:20:06.692
- What, you broke it?
- Of course he did.

00:20:06.694 --> 00:20:08.760
I didn't break it, it broke.

00:20:08.762 --> 00:20:10.831
Is that how you open a door
in your house?

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:13.766
- No.
- Well, don't be so rough with it.

00:20:13.768 --> 00:20:15.169
Well, excuse me, miss.
Ma'am.

00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:16.870
Oh, my God,
this is awesome.

00:20:16.872 --> 00:20:20.640
You guys, you guys,
I think this is the escape room.

00:20:20.642 --> 00:20:22.308
What?

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.943
Wait, what?

00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:26.513
Okay, it looks like
an oven dial, which means

00:20:26.515 --> 00:20:28.148
it's probably
a combination lock.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.482
All right,
everyone search the room.

00:20:29.484 --> 00:20:30.850
Wait, wait.
It's starting right now?

00:20:30.852 --> 00:20:32.184
- Yes.
- Oh!

00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:33.921
What are we looking for here,
bud?

00:20:33.923 --> 00:20:36.355
Anything that looks
like a puzzle or a code.

00:20:36.357 --> 00:20:40.093
Numbers are very important.
It could be anything, anywhere.

00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:41.628
Maybe under here.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.297
Do you want me
to hold on to this or is it...?

00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:46.735
Yeah, just hold your knob
there, guy.

00:20:48.002 --> 00:20:51.036
Great. Very funny. Yeah.

00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:22.102
Hey, guys.

00:21:22.104 --> 00:21:24.170
Hey, guys,
these are all addressed

00:21:24.172 --> 00:21:26.940
to the same guy,
this Dr. Wootan Yu.

00:21:26.942 --> 00:21:29.008
I mean, that's got to be
a clue, right?

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.776
Maybe that's the story.

00:21:30.778 --> 00:21:32.712
Maybe he's like
an evil scientist

00:21:32.714 --> 00:21:34.014
and we have to escape
his lab

00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:35.548
before he sews us all together

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.417
into some sort
of medical abomination.

00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:39.719
So,
his evil lab has a waiting room?

00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:41.654
- Yeah.
- No.

00:21:41.656 --> 00:21:43.590
Shit. Shit, shit.

00:21:43.592 --> 00:21:45.525
Guys, look, look.
I found a star-head screwdriver.

00:21:45.527 --> 00:21:47.561
That's got to be something,
right?

00:21:47.563 --> 00:21:49.930
Great.
So, we're looking for screws?

00:21:49.932 --> 00:21:52.300
Well, this isn't a hammer.

00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:57.103
- That's a star-head, right?
- I think so. Yeah.

00:21:57.105 --> 00:21:59.072
That's Fahrenheit 451.

00:21:59.074 --> 00:22:00.109
Oh.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.276
All right,
she's got something.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.984
- What was that?
- I don't know.

00:22:10.986 --> 00:22:12.988
Did that do anything?

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.292
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:20.826
Okay.

00:22:20.828 --> 00:22:23.296
- All right, now that's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

00:22:23.298 --> 00:22:25.331
Anybody got
suntan lotion?

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:27.100
What did you just do?

00:22:27.102 --> 00:22:29.068
I just thought the book was
the code for the oven dial.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.804
Turn it off, please.

00:22:30.806 --> 00:22:32.072
Wow, it's really throwing off
some heat.

00:22:32.074 --> 00:22:33.340
Yeah, it's warm.

00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:34.874
It's kicking some heat.

00:22:34.876 --> 00:22:36.375
What are those,
giant oven coils?

00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:38.076
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry. It's stuck.

00:22:38.078 --> 00:22:39.411
I can't move it.

00:22:39.413 --> 00:22:41.949
- Shit.
- This is crazy hot.

00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:45.651
- Can you shut it off?
- Shit. Okay.

00:22:45.653 --> 00:22:48.421
Don't touch anything else,
okay?

00:22:48.423 --> 00:22:50.457
Hey, you, gamer boy, there.

00:22:50.459 --> 00:22:52.124
What do we do?
How do we get out of here?

00:22:52.126 --> 00:22:54.094
When you're stuck,
you can ask for a hint.

00:22:54.096 --> 00:22:57.497
A hint? That's an option?
Okay, great. Here we go.

00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:59.399
Yeah, but it's way more fun
if we do it ourselves.

00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:00.600
Good one, gamer boy.

00:23:00.602 --> 00:23:01.767
I kind of want to do it
ourselves.

00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:03.503
Hi, excuse me.

00:23:03.505 --> 00:23:06.671
- We'd like our hint now, please.
- Yeah, hello.

00:23:06.673 --> 00:23:09.609
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:12.444
No, yeah, excuse me, we'd really
like our hint, please.

00:23:12.446 --> 00:23:15.849
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:17.920
- She said that last time.
- So?

00:23:19.653 --> 00:23:23.190
She said it the exact same way.
Same cadence, same tone.

00:23:23.192 --> 00:23:26.226
Well, the actors they hire
aren't exactly Dame Judi Dench.

00:23:26.228 --> 00:23:29.161
- Hello? Hello?
- I love Judi Dench.

00:23:31.833 --> 00:23:35.237
Yeah, I don't think the
snow globe's going to help, man.

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:43.476
Hey. Uh...

00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:45.311
Hey, guys,
there's a lock over here.

00:23:45.313 --> 00:23:48.148
Yes. Locks are a super important
part of escape rooms.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.548
All right.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.485
Okay, it looks like
we need a small key

00:23:51.487 --> 00:23:53.286
to get to the other side
of the partition.

00:23:53.288 --> 00:23:55.287
That's probably
where the next clue is.

00:23:55.289 --> 00:23:56.689
Well,
I'm not going to be any help there

00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:58.991
because I can never
find my keys.

00:24:00.496 --> 00:24:03.029
Hilarious.
Or we could just break it off.

00:24:03.031 --> 00:24:04.363
There's an extinguisher
right here.

00:24:04.365 --> 00:24:05.565
Yeah, good idea.

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:07.199
No, no. We shouldn't
have to use force.

00:24:07.201 --> 00:24:10.170
That's actually the one rule
I forgot to tell you. My bad.

00:24:10.172 --> 00:24:11.705
- Good one.
- Great.

00:24:11.707 --> 00:24:13.105
You're really good
at breaking stuff, huh?

00:24:13.107 --> 00:24:14.107
It's plastic.

00:24:18.413 --> 00:24:19.746
What was that?

00:24:19.748 --> 00:24:22.114
That's that same sound, right?

00:24:22.116 --> 00:24:24.116
Man,
what the hell did you just do?

00:24:24.118 --> 00:24:25.617
Oh! Oh.

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:26.754
Oh, shit.

00:24:28.923 --> 00:24:31.224
Oh, shit, that looks real.

00:24:31.226 --> 00:24:33.092
They're just trying
to give us a scare

00:24:33.094 --> 00:24:35.094
as part of
the immersive experience.

00:24:35.096 --> 00:24:36.863
What the hell,
are they paying you?

00:24:36.865 --> 00:24:38.465
No, I just know how to have
fun, I guess.

00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:40.065
Heat stroke is your idea
of fun?

00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:41.534
It's getting warm.

00:24:41.536 --> 00:24:43.769
Hey, it's not that bad.
Just take off your jacket.

00:24:43.771 --> 00:24:45.891
Hey, does anyone else
have a problem with this?

00:24:47.842 --> 00:24:50.375
Hey, guys,
I think I've got the key.

00:24:50.377 --> 00:24:52.344
Whoa, hey, there.
Listen, short stuff...

00:24:52.346 --> 00:24:54.280
let's talk about this
before you bring tiki torches

00:24:54.282 --> 00:24:56.915
- out of the walls, okay?
- Hold on now. She's got a key.

00:24:56.917 --> 00:24:59.285
Why don't we stick it
in the keyhole?

00:24:59.287 --> 00:25:02.122
Okay, yeah. My bad.
Let's try it.

00:25:02.124 --> 00:25:03.258
Give it a shot, come on.

00:25:12.601 --> 00:25:16.334
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

00:25:16.336 --> 00:25:18.603
Well, that's creepy as hell.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.819
Fine. Yeah.
I'll get it. Move.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.123
Hello.

00:25:37.125 --> 00:25:38.824
Welcome to Minos,

00:25:38.826 --> 00:25:41.193
the world's preeminent designer
of escape rooms.

00:25:41.195 --> 00:25:42.828
To get the most
out of your game,

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.333
we recommend following
all posted rules.

00:25:46.268 --> 00:25:48.834
Hey. Hey. Hello? Hello?

00:25:48.836 --> 00:25:50.469
Who was it? What did they say?

00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:51.804
It was a recording.

00:25:51.806 --> 00:25:54.073
It said to follow
all the posted rules.

00:25:54.075 --> 00:25:55.210
What posted rules?

00:25:57.311 --> 00:25:58.679
Oh, shit.

00:25:58.681 --> 00:26:00.846
- No.
- Did I do that?

00:26:00.848 --> 00:26:04.316
No, no. What the literal hell?

00:26:04.318 --> 00:26:07.019
Please stop. Okay, I'm done.

00:26:07.021 --> 00:26:10.523
No, no. You're stressing
everyone out here, okay?

00:26:10.525 --> 00:26:12.859
Just go get some water
and take off your damn jacket.

00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:14.693
We've got to find a way
out of this Easy-Bake Oven.

00:26:14.695 --> 00:26:16.062
Okay, look at me, look at me.
Amanda.

00:26:16.064 --> 00:26:17.064
Oh, shit.

00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:22.334
Are those fans?
Are they blowing hot air?

00:26:22.336 --> 00:26:23.902
We'll just get some water,
okay?

00:26:23.904 --> 00:26:25.203
Come and get
some water with me.

00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:26.373
I'm fine. Okay.

00:26:26.375 --> 00:26:27.641
Yeah, it's getting hot,

00:26:27.643 --> 00:26:29.475
but nothing is going
to happen to us.

00:26:29.477 --> 00:26:32.077
- Ovens have fans.
- True, but so what?

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:33.412
We've got to find
the posted rules.

00:26:33.414 --> 00:26:34.881
I don't care about the
posted rules.

00:26:34.883 --> 00:26:36.649
It might be colder
by the windows.

00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:38.053
I'm burning up.

00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:42.124
Come on,
how do we get out of here?

00:26:44.224 --> 00:26:46.660
You're not going to solve
anything by sitting on your ass.

00:26:46.662 --> 00:26:49.431
I'm not sitting on my ass.
I'm on my hands and knees.

00:26:52.134 --> 00:26:55.034
Hey, what are you three doing?
Look for something, come on.

00:26:55.036 --> 00:26:57.503
It's too hot.
What do you want me to do?

00:26:57.505 --> 00:26:59.005
Ladies, come on,
enough with the water.

00:26:59.007 --> 00:27:00.840
Get over here
and help us look.

00:27:00.842 --> 00:27:02.542
We just have to figure
out what the clue meant.

00:27:02.544 --> 00:27:04.376
Hold on. What's this?

00:27:04.378 --> 00:27:06.345
There's no way this
is part of the game.

00:27:06.347 --> 00:27:08.180
Where are all the clues at,
huh?

00:27:08.182 --> 00:27:09.582
Ah!

00:27:09.584 --> 00:27:11.249
Guys, come on.
It's getting hot in here.

00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:13.018
We've got to find something
to break this door open.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.255
Dude,
we're not supposed to use force.

00:27:15.257 --> 00:27:16.325
Come on!

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:20.125
When is this over?
How do we get out?

00:27:20.127 --> 00:27:23.062
It's getting hotter.
We're being baked alive.

00:27:23.064 --> 00:27:24.596
Guys, relax.

00:27:24.598 --> 00:27:27.199
This is sick. Who does this?

00:27:27.201 --> 00:27:29.035
Come on, Ben.

00:27:29.037 --> 00:27:31.904
What do you want me to do?
I can't see anything.

00:27:31.906 --> 00:27:34.273
Guys,
we need to focus and find the clues.

00:27:34.275 --> 00:27:36.042
It's like 150 degrees in here.

00:27:37.078 --> 00:27:39.446
Hey. Hey, Zoey, the painting.

00:27:39.448 --> 00:27:41.148
Oh, my God. There's an exit.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.914
Oh, hot dog, look at that.

00:27:42.916 --> 00:27:45.953
Zoey, do that again. Whatever
you did, just do it again.

00:27:49.723 --> 00:27:52.757
Hey, guys, it's a duct.
It could be a way out.

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:54.861
Guys,
there are more coasters here.

00:27:54.863 --> 00:27:56.362
Get on the coasters.

00:27:56.364 --> 00:27:58.096
Everyone try pressing down
at the same time.

00:27:58.098 --> 00:27:59.967
God, even the table's hot.

00:28:06.575 --> 00:28:08.607
- Is that it? Did we win the game?
- Yeah.

00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:10.442
- I'll go first.
- All right, we win the game.

00:28:10.444 --> 00:28:12.478
Whoa, whoa. Wait, you're
not going to just leave us

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.046
with our dicks in our hands.

00:28:14.048 --> 00:28:17.150
Does anybody prefer
this guy go instead of me?

00:28:17.152 --> 00:28:19.555
- That's what I thought.
- Really?

00:28:28.163 --> 00:28:29.530
Where does it go?

00:28:31.432 --> 00:28:34.502
- How deep does it go?
- It goes pretty far.

00:28:37.605 --> 00:28:39.138
Jesus Christ.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.509
It's broiling.

00:28:43.178 --> 00:28:45.010
It's not getting
any cooler in here.

00:28:45.012 --> 00:28:47.113
Oh, my God. I'm so excited
for the next room.

00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:48.680
- The next room?
- Jason?

00:28:48.682 --> 00:28:52.785
Hey, I think I found a way out!
It's blocked by a grate.

00:28:52.787 --> 00:28:55.654
- Mike, bring that screwdriver.
- Yeah! It's in my pocket.

00:28:55.656 --> 00:28:57.590
Someone get it out of my pocket
for me. Come here, Amanda.

00:28:57.592 --> 00:28:59.158
Does anybody want
to take the screwdriver?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.793
- I've got it, I've got it. Go.
- Are you sure?

00:29:00.795 --> 00:29:02.460
Yeah. Go, go.

00:29:02.462 --> 00:29:04.830
- Just do it.
- You've got this, Mike.

00:29:04.832 --> 00:29:09.702
Go, man. It's not getting any colder.
Hurry up, go.

00:29:09.704 --> 00:29:12.139
- Mike, where you at?
- I'm coming.

00:29:18.813 --> 00:29:22.581
Hey, hey. Just think of it
like interactive dinner theater.

00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:24.217
Jesus Christ,
you're not helping me here, man.

00:29:24.219 --> 00:29:27.753
Okay, yeah.
I'm making it worse. My bad.

00:29:27.755 --> 00:29:30.459
Are you going
to come today or what?

00:29:33.362 --> 00:29:36.562
- Watch your face down there.
- You watch your face up there.

00:29:36.564 --> 00:29:38.066
Come on. Come on, come on.

00:29:41.702 --> 00:29:43.805
Hey, I got it.
You guys, come on!

00:29:45.707 --> 00:29:49.007
Do you want to go?
Amanda, you should go.

00:29:49.009 --> 00:29:50.977
Okay. Okay, here, take these.

00:29:50.979 --> 00:29:53.680
Okay. He can take that.
I'll hold it.

00:29:53.682 --> 00:29:56.347
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

00:29:56.349 --> 00:29:57.850
You've got this.

00:29:57.852 --> 00:29:59.221
All right.

00:30:05.227 --> 00:30:07.559
I feel like we're avoiding
the inevitable conclusion here.

00:30:07.561 --> 00:30:09.798
We're running out of hands.

00:30:12.366 --> 00:30:15.366
I've got an idea. Come here.
Put your foot on here, please.

00:30:15.368 --> 00:30:16.605
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Okay.

00:30:20.409 --> 00:30:23.209
This is the worst game
of Twister ever.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.451
Can we move a little
faster, please?

00:30:33.788 --> 00:30:35.720
- It didn't work.
- Shit.

00:30:35.722 --> 00:30:37.623
Okay,
maybe it needs to be full.

00:30:37.625 --> 00:30:40.328
- I think I'm going to pass out.
- Okay.

00:30:41.796 --> 00:30:45.265
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

00:30:45.267 --> 00:30:47.469
You can move your foot. Okay.

00:30:50.838 --> 00:30:52.238
- It worked!
- Yes, yes.

00:31:14.762 --> 00:31:16.429
Amanda?

00:31:16.431 --> 00:31:17.997
Hey, why don't you
just go help her?

00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:19.164
We'll fill the glasses.

00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:20.432
Stop being chivalrous,
dude.

00:31:20.434 --> 00:31:22.000
No one here
wants to have sex with you.

00:31:22.002 --> 00:31:23.135
- Go!
- Okay.

00:31:23.137 --> 00:31:25.603
Nice. Really nice, Ben.

00:31:25.605 --> 00:31:26.805
Shit.

00:31:26.807 --> 00:31:29.076
- Come on.
- Okay.

00:31:33.981 --> 00:31:36.151
She's clear.
Go, go, go. Come on.

00:31:37.852 --> 00:31:39.651
Come on,
you son of a bitch, please.

00:31:39.653 --> 00:31:40.987
Come on, come on, come on.

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:44.023
Amanda? Amanda, I'm here.

00:31:44.025 --> 00:31:45.761
Okay. Good.

00:31:48.395 --> 00:31:51.029
What's wrong? You can breathe.
You're not stuck.

00:31:51.031 --> 00:31:53.798
Breathe in with me.
One, two...

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.603
Two more.

00:31:57.605 --> 00:31:59.638
This is not real.
You're not stuck.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.008
You're okay. I'm here, okay?
I'm holding your hand.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.812
I promise I'm right here.
You're okay.

00:32:06.614 --> 00:32:09.047
Okay, we need one more.
We just need one more.

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:10.949
Shit, we're out of water.

00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:12.317
What are we
supposed to do now?

00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:14.319
How would I know?
You're the expert here.

00:32:14.321 --> 00:32:16.488
We're really close.
We're really close, I promise.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.655
This is all your fault,
you know.

00:32:17.657 --> 00:32:19.124
- What?
- You're the reason

00:32:19.126 --> 00:32:20.559
that Amanda drank
all of our clues.

00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:22.527
Jason's right there, okay?

00:32:22.529 --> 00:32:26.231
How was I supposed to know
that the water cooler was...

00:32:26.233 --> 00:32:27.735
Oh, no.

00:32:31.439 --> 00:32:33.909
- Well, that's not good.
- What the fuck?

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.248
My flask. My flask.

00:32:41.415 --> 00:32:43.217
You've had that
the whole time?

00:32:47.221 --> 00:32:48.423
Oh, my God.

00:32:50.191 --> 00:32:53.258
Come on! Yes. Yes.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.262
Do you want to burn to death?
Let's go!

00:33:14.449 --> 00:33:16.615
What the hell?

00:33:16.617 --> 00:33:20.253
Oh, Jesus.
Talk about immersive.

00:33:20.255 --> 00:33:23.588
Immersive? What the hell is
wrong with you? That was real!

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.424
- They're just messing with us.
- Are you kidding me, dude?

00:33:26.426 --> 00:33:28.395
Look, it went off
right as I cleared it.

00:33:29.462 --> 00:33:31.498
Okay, I must have triggered it.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.466
The Games Master wants us
to think we barely made it.

00:33:33.468 --> 00:33:35.066
I can't be the only one.

00:33:35.068 --> 00:33:37.603
Hey. It's ten grand
and I don't lose.

00:33:37.605 --> 00:33:40.271
Well, I'm out, okay?

00:33:40.273 --> 00:33:41.774
Hi. Okay, I'm done.

00:33:41.776 --> 00:33:43.676
I want out.
You let me out of here now!

00:33:43.678 --> 00:33:45.911
You think they're
watching us right now?

00:33:45.913 --> 00:33:49.782
- Come on.
- "Sai-San lock and co."

00:33:49.784 --> 00:33:51.249
All right,
so we need another key.

00:33:51.251 --> 00:33:52.817
Give me your phone.
I'm calling the cops.

00:33:52.819 --> 00:33:54.086
Think about it for a
second, okay?

00:33:54.088 --> 00:33:55.688
What has actually happened
to us so far?

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.523
Nothing. What will you
tell the cops?

00:33:57.525 --> 00:33:58.991
I don't know,
maybe that they locked us

00:33:58.993 --> 00:34:00.758
in a giant oven
and tried to cook us.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.228
Is open flame a common
occurrence in these things?

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.395
- Not really.
- Not really.

00:34:04.397 --> 00:34:06.998
Give me your goddamn phone.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.067
You do have a phone.
How did you get a phone in here?

00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:10.172
I snuck it in.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.275
- There's no signal.
- Typical.

00:34:15.277 --> 00:34:18.510
Well, yeah. We're in
a giant concrete building.

00:34:18.512 --> 00:34:21.179
Guys, we can figure this out.
I mean, look at this place.

00:34:21.181 --> 00:34:24.148
I mean, the only thing missing
is the hot chocolate.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.351
All right, how long do you
think this game is going to last?

00:34:26.353 --> 00:34:29.153
I mean, I don't know. I did one
that had, like, five rooms once.

00:34:29.155 --> 00:34:31.090
Five?

00:34:31.092 --> 00:34:33.726
Five rooms? Okay.

00:34:33.728 --> 00:34:37.231
Okay. So, that means we just
need to do that four more times.

00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:40.566
I'm kidding. Come on, guys,
we can do this.

00:34:40.568 --> 00:34:42.200
That was the hardest room
by far, right?

00:34:42.202 --> 00:34:43.903
They front-loaded it,
right, Danny?

00:34:43.905 --> 00:34:45.871
Yeah. I mean,
I'm sure they can't afford

00:34:45.873 --> 00:34:47.238
to light every room
on fire.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.874
Exactly. Look at it.

00:34:48.876 --> 00:34:50.976
This place is
a goddamn tinder box.

00:34:50.978 --> 00:34:55.179
Hey. Hey, second lock, guys.

00:34:55.181 --> 00:34:57.218
It looks like we need
a seven-letter word.

00:34:58.753 --> 00:35:01.987
Let's spread out
and see what we can find.

00:35:01.989 --> 00:35:03.224
Okay.

00:35:14.034 --> 00:35:16.302
"You'll go down in history."

00:35:16.304 --> 00:35:18.403
What about this?
Could that mean something?

00:35:18.405 --> 00:35:20.072
"You'll go down in history."

00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:22.708
You'll go down in history.
You'll go down in history.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.811
Maybe a president's name?
Maybe a president's last name.

00:35:24.813 --> 00:35:26.878
What presidents have
a seven-letter last name?

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.148
Madison, Jackson.
Lincoln, Johnson, Harding.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.818
- Whoa. Slow down there, Rain Man.
- That's offensive.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.688
What was the first one?
Madison.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:40.459
M-A-D-I-

00:35:40.461 --> 00:35:44.530
-S-O-N.

00:35:44.532 --> 00:35:48.099
No, that didn't work.
What was another one?

00:35:48.101 --> 00:35:49.936
- Johnson.
- Johnson. Okay, Johnson.

00:35:49.938 --> 00:35:53.139
J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

00:35:53.141 --> 00:35:54.807
No, what else?

00:35:54.809 --> 00:35:58.811
Yeah, Jackson. J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
What's the next name?

00:35:58.813 --> 00:36:00.947
- Try Lincoln. Lincoln.
- Lincoln?

00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:02.280
L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

00:36:02.282 --> 00:36:05.351
There are letters here,
but there are nine.

00:36:05.353 --> 00:36:06.988
No, that doesn't work either.

00:36:12.193 --> 00:36:15.128
♪ How the reindeer
Loved him ♪

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.764
♪ As they shouted out
With glee ♪

00:36:18.766 --> 00:36:22.300
♪ Rudolph
The red-nosed reindeer ♪

00:36:22.302 --> 00:36:27.606
♪ You'll go down in history ♪

00:36:32.746 --> 00:36:36.014
Dasher, Dancer,
Prancer, Vixen...

00:36:36.016 --> 00:36:38.786
Comet, Cupid, Donner,
Blitzen.

00:36:40.788 --> 00:36:43.923
- You'll go down in history.
- What is he talking about?

00:36:43.925 --> 00:36:46.092
- It's "Rudolph."
- Did he say "Rudolph"?

00:36:46.094 --> 00:36:49.230
- Yeah, try "Rudolph."
- All right, "Rudolph" it is.

00:36:53.166 --> 00:36:54.367
Bingo!

00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:56.635
Look at that.
Hey, he helps.

00:36:56.637 --> 00:36:58.537
All right.

00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:01.007
Hey, see?
It's going to be fine from now on.

00:37:01.009 --> 00:37:02.844
No more scary shit.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.059
Hey...

00:37:19.126 --> 00:37:20.661
are you okay?

00:37:22.195 --> 00:37:23.797
Yeah, fine.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.367
Look at this,
going from hot to cold.

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:31.170
You know,
that's how you get sick.

00:37:40.047 --> 00:37:41.347
Whoa.

00:37:46.353 --> 00:37:49.423
Dumb question.
Are we outside...

00:37:51.492 --> 00:37:54.360
or am I
stone-cold tripping?

00:37:54.362 --> 00:37:57.565
I don't know, man.
This place is really cold.

00:38:01.235 --> 00:38:04.903
It's 30 degrees and dropping.

00:38:04.905 --> 00:38:07.338
Real fun game, huh?

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.941
- Echo!
- Hey.

00:38:08.943 --> 00:38:10.642
This whole place is bullshit.

00:38:10.644 --> 00:38:12.043
The sooner we figure this out,

00:38:12.045 --> 00:38:13.244
the sooner we get
the hell of out here.

00:38:13.246 --> 00:38:14.880
This is beautiful. Oh, man,

00:38:14.882 --> 00:38:17.249
I could hang out in here
for a while.

00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:19.120
It's like ice skating.

00:38:21.188 --> 00:38:23.856
- Into the great wide open, Danny!
- Be careful.

00:38:25.092 --> 00:38:27.193
Keep going, man.
Check it out.

00:38:27.195 --> 00:38:30.432
- Yeah, where are you going?
- Let him figure it out.

00:38:35.402 --> 00:38:38.704
Whoa!

00:38:38.706 --> 00:38:41.374
- Guys?
- Hey, nobody move.

00:38:41.376 --> 00:38:44.709
Come on, guys. Relax, okay?
It's fine. Look.

00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:45.744
Hey, don't do that.

00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:47.146
It's just a sound effect.

00:38:47.148 --> 00:38:48.414
The ice isn't cracking.

00:38:48.416 --> 00:38:49.949
They are watching to make sure

00:38:49.951 --> 00:38:51.284
nothing bad happens to us.

00:38:51.286 --> 00:38:53.050
I mean, can you imagine
the lawsuits

00:38:53.052 --> 00:38:55.086
if one of us
actually got hurt?

00:38:55.088 --> 00:38:58.460
Learn to have some fun
in your life. Jeez.

00:39:00.827 --> 00:39:02.697
Whoever did this is an artist.

00:39:04.465 --> 00:39:05.465
What is that?

00:39:07.101 --> 00:39:10.168
- Danny, come on back.
- Get over here. Hurry up, Danny.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.403
Shit.

00:39:11.405 --> 00:39:12.403
There's freezing air

00:39:12.405 --> 00:39:13.405
coming through those vents.

00:39:13.407 --> 00:39:14.539
Come on, Danny!

00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:15.974
Danny, get back here.

00:39:15.976 --> 00:39:17.976
Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

00:39:17.978 --> 00:39:20.579
- Shit, that is cold.
- Get together for body heat.

00:39:20.581 --> 00:39:23.248
- Oh, the air is freezing.
- Stay close.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.950
- This is awesome.
- Why are they doing this?

00:39:25.952 --> 00:39:28.789
- Come on, get closer.
- Oh, my God, that's cold.

00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:35.096
We should look for clues.

00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:44.336
Hello?

00:39:44.338 --> 00:39:45.373
Hey.

00:39:47.807 --> 00:39:49.710
Open, open, open.

00:39:58.518 --> 00:40:00.686
Hey.

00:40:00.688 --> 00:40:02.856
- Yeah, do you want to look?
- Yeah.

00:40:06.693 --> 00:40:08.563
"True north is a lie."

00:40:19.706 --> 00:40:21.643
What are you looking at?

00:40:27.481 --> 00:40:28.583
Good boy.

00:40:31.552 --> 00:40:33.688
Hey, I found a door.
We need a small key.

00:40:37.724 --> 00:40:39.825
Where did that come from?

00:40:39.827 --> 00:40:42.695
One coat for six people?

00:40:42.697 --> 00:40:44.863
You know what they're
trying to do, right?

00:40:44.865 --> 00:40:48.702
They want us to fight over
limited resources. Jesus Christ.

00:40:49.903 --> 00:40:52.838
Hey. Hey, assholes.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.173
It's not going to work
this time, okay?

00:40:55.175 --> 00:40:56.575
We're going to share it.

00:40:56.577 --> 00:40:59.380
Zoey, you go first.

00:41:00.246 --> 00:41:01.748
Thank you.

00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:15.930
- Shit, that's cold.
- Ben.

00:41:22.603 --> 00:41:25.436
Shit! Oh, that's cold.

00:41:25.438 --> 00:41:28.440
Hey, false alarm, everybody.

00:41:28.442 --> 00:41:30.608
A giant fishing hole.
How did you miss that?

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.510
What are we supposed to do
with this?

00:41:32.512 --> 00:41:34.012
There could be a clue
at the bottom.

00:41:34.014 --> 00:41:36.847
Oh, really? Why don't you
go dive in and check?

00:41:36.849 --> 00:41:39.050
Okay, it just feels like
I'm playing

00:41:39.052 --> 00:41:41.887
the world's funnest game
with the world's meanest people.

00:41:41.889 --> 00:41:44.389
I can't feel my goddamn leg.

00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:47.092
- Hey, guys.
- Mike?

00:41:47.094 --> 00:41:48.793
Ha!

00:41:48.795 --> 00:41:51.329
Look, I've got it.

00:41:51.331 --> 00:41:53.666
I mean, I've got something.

00:41:53.668 --> 00:41:55.300
I just climbed a tree for,
like,

00:41:55.302 --> 00:41:57.168
the first time
in my goddamn life.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.670
Danny, tell me this is something
we can use.

00:41:58.672 --> 00:42:01.072
Yeah, totally. It's a clue.

00:42:01.074 --> 00:42:04.309
Finally,
something I'm good at.

00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:07.746
You mean you can stand
over a hole and hold a stick?

00:42:07.748 --> 00:42:09.914
Wow, thank God you're here.

00:42:09.916 --> 00:42:11.816
I understand
you're cold right now,

00:42:11.818 --> 00:42:13.617
but if you say something
disrespectful to me

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:15.586
like that again...
I'm going to give you

00:42:15.588 --> 00:42:17.523
the slap your parents
should have years ago.

00:42:17.525 --> 00:42:19.124
- Oh, really?
- That's amazing.

00:42:19.126 --> 00:42:20.726
With pleasure.

00:42:20.728 --> 00:42:22.494
So, what are we
supposed to do now,

00:42:22.496 --> 00:42:24.896
just stand here and wait
to catch a clue?

00:42:24.898 --> 00:42:26.764
Well,
it's probably really deep.

00:42:26.766 --> 00:42:29.400
Yeah,
I'm about 20 feet down already.

00:42:29.402 --> 00:42:30.937
I can't even see.

00:42:33.172 --> 00:42:34.773
This is a waste of time.

00:42:34.775 --> 00:42:36.075
You think this
is a waste of time?

00:42:36.077 --> 00:42:37.608
- Yeah.
- It's so goddamn cold.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.276
I do.
I think it's a distraction.

00:42:39.278 --> 00:42:41.146
I think this whole
thing is a waste of time.

00:42:41.148 --> 00:42:42.981
I climbed up to
the top of that tree.

00:42:42.983 --> 00:42:44.518
I found a fishing rod
up there.

00:42:46.487 --> 00:42:48.189
True north.

00:42:50.324 --> 00:42:51.526
What?

00:42:55.028 --> 00:42:58.396
What are you trying
to tell me?

00:42:58.398 --> 00:43:00.434
True north is a lie.

00:43:05.206 --> 00:43:07.572
They're probably watching us,
laughing their asses off,

00:43:07.574 --> 00:43:10.041
as we stand around a hole
like a bunch of morons.

00:43:10.043 --> 00:43:12.309
- We probably just have to wait.
- Oh, screw that, man.

00:43:12.311 --> 00:43:14.646
Give me this, Mike.
Mike, give me the pole!

00:43:14.648 --> 00:43:15.981
Why don't you chill out, man?

00:43:15.983 --> 00:43:17.249
You don't know
what you're doing, man.

00:43:17.251 --> 00:43:18.749
You don't even have
the release open.

00:43:18.751 --> 00:43:19.918
Don't let it out.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.755
You've got to drop it
to the bottom.

00:43:29.963 --> 00:43:30.963
Shit, that's deep.

00:43:33.134 --> 00:43:35.400
Screw this. Here, take this.

00:43:35.402 --> 00:43:36.503
Give me that back.

00:43:37.737 --> 00:43:39.637
I'm sorry, all right?

00:43:39.639 --> 00:43:42.508
I hate the cold
and it makes me go crazy.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.376
I have to spend every winter
in Kauai.

00:43:44.378 --> 00:43:46.881
Me, too. When I'm not
in the South of France.

00:43:49.983 --> 00:43:52.517
Hey, where's Zoey
with that jacket?

00:43:52.519 --> 00:43:53.887
I need that jacket.

00:44:06.867 --> 00:44:07.867
Yes.

00:44:11.972 --> 00:44:14.307
Hey, you mind not
smoking that around me?

00:44:22.548 --> 00:44:25.117
Pull up the line.
I found something.

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:26.851
- Pull up the line.
- What?

00:44:26.853 --> 00:44:29.054
Everyone, I found something.

00:44:29.056 --> 00:44:30.588
What do you got there?

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.791
Another clue?
Impressive, Zoey.

00:44:32.793 --> 00:44:35.193
- What is it?
- Okay.

00:44:35.195 --> 00:44:37.765
- A magnet, of course.
- I'm with you. Okay, okay.

00:44:40.266 --> 00:44:42.099
Okay, try it. Try it now.

00:44:42.101 --> 00:44:44.635
All right, all right.
Stand back.

00:44:44.637 --> 00:44:46.804
There she goes.

00:44:46.806 --> 00:44:50.177
Zoey, your turn is up.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:52.813
Right. Sorry.

00:44:54.248 --> 00:44:56.847
Oh, shit.
Okay. I'm on the bottom.

00:44:56.849 --> 00:44:58.083
No, I'm hooked.

00:44:58.085 --> 00:44:59.584
All right,
I've got something.

00:44:59.586 --> 00:45:00.786
I've got something here.

00:45:00.788 --> 00:45:02.153
Yeah,
I'm definitely hooked.

00:45:02.155 --> 00:45:03.523
Oh, God.

00:45:05.092 --> 00:45:07.758
- Nice.
- God, that's heavy.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.293
Okay. Okay, I've got it.
I've got it.

00:45:09.295 --> 00:45:11.030
You've got it?

00:45:11.032 --> 00:45:12.996
We've got a key or something.

00:45:12.998 --> 00:45:14.932
You've got it. Okay.

00:45:14.934 --> 00:45:17.038
That's got to
be the key to the door.

00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:22.773
- Who thinks of this shit?
- One, two, three.

00:45:22.775 --> 00:45:26.412
Okay. One, two, three.

00:45:26.414 --> 00:45:28.015
- Okay.
- Shit, that is solid.

00:45:32.652 --> 00:45:36.122
- Hey, Ben. We need your lighter.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

00:45:37.257 --> 00:45:39.791
What do I get in return?

00:45:39.793 --> 00:45:42.793
I won't take
any of your One Direction CDs.

00:45:45.097 --> 00:45:47.032
Come on, just give it, man.

00:45:47.034 --> 00:45:49.467
All right,
you want the lighter?

00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:51.103
Here.

00:45:51.105 --> 00:45:52.537
There you go.

00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:59.911
- Okay, I'll get it.
- Thanks, Danny.

00:45:59.913 --> 00:46:01.546
I don't know.

00:46:01.548 --> 00:46:03.914
Man, that is buried
right in the center, isn't it?

00:46:03.916 --> 00:46:06.686
Oh, and you're welcome,
by the way.

00:46:09.489 --> 00:46:10.557
Thanks a lot.

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:20.099
Danny?

00:46:22.735 --> 00:46:25.772
What was that? What happened?
Where's Danny?

00:46:26.907 --> 00:46:28.139
Say something. Where is he?

00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:29.641
He just fell through.

00:46:29.643 --> 00:46:31.242
What do you
mean, he fell through?

00:46:31.244 --> 00:46:32.409
He's under the ice!

00:46:32.411 --> 00:46:35.146
Danny! Danny! Danny!

00:46:35.148 --> 00:46:37.016
All right,
I'm going in after him.

00:46:37.018 --> 00:46:38.983
No, no. There is
a current under there.

00:46:38.985 --> 00:46:40.251
Even if you find him,

00:46:40.253 --> 00:46:42.056
you will not make it
back to the hole.

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.226
Danny, where are you?

00:46:47.994 --> 00:46:50.030
He's being dragged
around under there.

00:46:53.567 --> 00:46:54.865
Danny!

00:46:54.867 --> 00:46:56.501
Danny, where are you?

00:46:56.503 --> 00:46:58.606
- Danny! Where did he go?
- Do you see him?

00:47:00.407 --> 00:47:01.742
- I can't see him.
- Danny!

00:47:03.376 --> 00:47:05.846
Shush, shush, shush! Shush!

00:47:11.083 --> 00:47:14.020
- Oh, my God. Danny.
- Where is he?

00:47:21.061 --> 00:47:23.628
Danny. Danny, Danny.

00:47:25.733 --> 00:47:27.335
What happened?

00:47:38.644 --> 00:47:40.181
You were right.

00:47:42.148 --> 00:47:43.750
This is real.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.360
How did it happen?

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.829
Hey!

00:47:56.396 --> 00:47:58.630
- How did it happen?
- What?

00:47:58.632 --> 00:48:01.633
How did Danny fall in?
You're the only one who saw.

00:48:01.635 --> 00:48:06.003
He was there and then it
exploded and then he fell.

00:48:06.005 --> 00:48:09.508
You threw him the lighter and
somehow you're perfectly fine?

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.809
I threw it across the ice.
I was just being an asshole.

00:48:11.811 --> 00:48:13.278
Yeah, you threw it
to the exact spot

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.479
that just happened
to collapse?

00:48:14.481 --> 00:48:15.947
Are you saying that I did it?

00:48:15.949 --> 00:48:17.650
Yeah, hey, your words,
not mine.

00:48:19.286 --> 00:48:21.487
Danny kept talking
about a Games Master.

00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:24.354
Yeah. Well,
maybe he's already here.

00:48:24.356 --> 00:48:27.992
Games Master? I work at
a grocery store, all right?

00:48:27.994 --> 00:48:29.494
I mean, Jason's the one here

00:48:29.496 --> 00:48:31.229
with the whole
American Psycho vibe.

00:48:31.231 --> 00:48:33.999
Mike, you're like the creep
at the truck stop.

00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:35.666
And Zoey, I'm really sorry,

00:48:35.668 --> 00:48:37.970
but it seems like your parents
locked you in a basement

00:48:37.972 --> 00:48:39.670
until you finished
all your homework.

00:48:39.672 --> 00:48:41.106
And her. What about her?

00:48:41.108 --> 00:48:42.773
I mean, where did
she get all the scars?

00:48:42.775 --> 00:48:44.309
I served in Iraq,
asshole.

00:48:44.311 --> 00:48:46.211
Oh, so you've had
military experience?

00:48:46.213 --> 00:48:47.548
So, that makes you like a...

00:48:49.715 --> 00:48:52.184
psycho Xena.

00:48:52.186 --> 00:48:55.686
I'm just saying here, I'm,
like, the least suspicious one.

00:48:55.688 --> 00:48:57.389
Okay, you know what?
Shut up!

00:48:57.391 --> 00:49:00.157
None of it matters,
all right?

00:49:00.159 --> 00:49:02.025
Whoever did this to us
will let us freeze to death,

00:49:02.027 --> 00:49:03.897
if we don't get the key
out of that ice.

00:49:05.565 --> 00:49:08.333
Okay. Since Ben's
lighter is gone,

00:49:08.335 --> 00:49:11.202
we have to surround it with
as much body heat as possible.

00:49:11.204 --> 00:49:12.539
Ben's lighter
is gone?

00:49:14.273 --> 00:49:16.742
Danny is dead.

00:49:16.744 --> 00:49:20.010
Do you know what happens
when you get hypothermia?

00:49:20.012 --> 00:49:22.246
Huh?

00:49:22.248 --> 00:49:25.282
You get disoriented
and confused.

00:49:25.284 --> 00:49:26.952
And I don't care
how smart you are

00:49:26.954 --> 00:49:28.220
or how many books
you read,

00:49:28.222 --> 00:49:29.954
you won't remember
how you got here,

00:49:29.956 --> 00:49:31.289
much less how to get out.

00:49:31.291 --> 00:49:32.791
You guys get over here

00:49:32.793 --> 00:49:34.795
and put your hands
on this ice.

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:47.405
I know it's cold,
but it's melting, guys.

00:49:47.407 --> 00:49:49.173
Come on,
just keep your hands on it.

00:49:49.175 --> 00:49:50.945
Hey, jacket.

00:49:59.253 --> 00:50:02.054
Let me take it for a minute.
Oh, that's cold.

00:50:02.056 --> 00:50:06.159
Okay. Here. Jesus.

00:50:19.472 --> 00:50:22.173
How are you doing
there, Mike?

00:50:22.175 --> 00:50:23.974
- Oh, you know.
- Need a break?

00:50:23.976 --> 00:50:26.244
Mm-mm. No, I got it.

00:50:26.246 --> 00:50:29.012
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Thank you.

00:50:29.014 --> 00:50:31.184
I just can't
figure it out.

00:50:33.186 --> 00:50:34.288
Who would do this?

00:50:36.121 --> 00:50:38.692
Someone who thought
of every detail.

00:51:00.914 --> 00:51:02.613
- Mike?
- Hey, Mike.

00:51:02.615 --> 00:51:04.449
Hey, put your back
against the tree.

00:51:04.451 --> 00:51:06.583
- No, I'm okay.
- We're here, okay?

00:51:10.356 --> 00:51:11.956
Hey, we're here,
we're here.

00:51:11.958 --> 00:51:13.358
- Jason?
- Where's he going?

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.159
He's got the key.
You guys, come on.

00:51:15.161 --> 00:51:17.096
- Get up, come on.
- Okay.

00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:22.034
- Where is it at?
- Hey, Jason.

00:51:22.036 --> 00:51:23.901
Where's it at?
Where's the door?

00:51:23.903 --> 00:51:27.505
- Jason!
- Get off me!

00:51:27.507 --> 00:51:29.974
Where's the door?

00:51:29.976 --> 00:51:31.842
There's a door?

00:51:31.844 --> 00:51:33.077
Open it.

00:51:33.079 --> 00:51:36.180
Open the goddamn door!
Open up!

00:51:36.182 --> 00:51:39.316
Open this door!
Open the goddamn door!

00:51:40.954 --> 00:51:44.225
Hey, you did it,
you opened a door.

00:51:45.826 --> 00:51:47.825
- Move.
- Jason! Let's go!

00:51:47.827 --> 00:51:50.128
Wait.

00:51:52.032 --> 00:51:53.267
Oh, shit!

00:51:56.635 --> 00:51:58.135
- Wait, wait.
- Zoey, come on!

00:51:58.137 --> 00:51:59.137
Wait for me!

00:52:01.173 --> 00:52:02.240
Ben!

00:52:08.914 --> 00:52:10.985
Hey, is everyone okay?

00:52:13.086 --> 00:52:15.452
I can't feel my extremities.

00:52:15.454 --> 00:52:16.755
What is that?

00:52:23.563 --> 00:52:25.099
Uh-huh.

00:52:26.599 --> 00:52:29.402
Sure, why not?

00:52:35.708 --> 00:52:37.608
Well...

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:41.378
glass half full,
at least it's warm in here.

00:52:42.748 --> 00:52:44.282
Oh, my God.

00:52:44.284 --> 00:52:45.784
What's happening?
What is that?

00:52:45.786 --> 00:52:47.784
- Are we moving?
- Yeah. Hold on.

00:52:48.956 --> 00:52:52.055
- What, are we going up?
- Yeah.

00:52:52.057 --> 00:52:53.958
How many floors
is this building?

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.626
15 to 20 floors.

00:52:55.628 --> 00:52:58.565
Well, I'm guessing they didn't
shoot us up here for the view.

00:53:21.521 --> 00:53:23.088
Okay.

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:24.692
How are we supposed to
answer that?

00:53:32.766 --> 00:53:33.766
Hello?

00:53:36.335 --> 00:53:39.271
Son of a bitch!

00:53:39.273 --> 00:53:41.975
God, that's loud.
And it sucks.

00:53:43.643 --> 00:53:46.010
Oh, great, we're going to
die to elevator music.

00:53:46.012 --> 00:53:49.347
Guys, hey, this door up here
doesn't have a handle.

00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:51.782
I think we're
looking for a doorknob.

00:53:51.784 --> 00:53:53.684
Let's see
what we can find.

00:53:53.686 --> 00:53:56.987
♪ Listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city ♪

00:53:56.989 --> 00:54:00.992
♪ Linger on the sidewalk
The neon signs are pretty ♪

00:54:00.994 --> 00:54:04.963
♪ How can you lose
The lights are much... ♪

00:54:04.965 --> 00:54:08.666
Hey, the eight ball, it's
missing from the pool table.

00:54:08.668 --> 00:54:11.101
Look at that. I'm going to
check these cue racks.

00:54:11.103 --> 00:54:14.005
Maybe there's something
over here we can use.

00:54:16.242 --> 00:54:18.075
- Hey. Mike, stop!
- Mike! Mike!

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.579
Get away from the edge.
Grab onto something.

00:54:21.581 --> 00:54:23.548
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Mike, step back! Mike!

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.816
- Guys, come on.
- Hey, get off the floor!

00:54:25.818 --> 00:54:29.586
Mike, hurry up!
Mike, get off the floor.

00:54:29.588 --> 00:54:32.157
- Shit.
- Did you see that?

00:54:32.159 --> 00:54:34.559
What the hell's going on?

00:54:39.097 --> 00:54:41.902
What is this,
like, musical chairs?

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:45.869
What do we do now?

00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:48.171
I don't know, try not to die.

00:54:48.173 --> 00:54:50.340
Hey, Amanda,
just think about this.

00:54:50.342 --> 00:54:51.543
Just let me try this.

00:54:51.545 --> 00:54:53.010
Go, go, go.

00:54:56.215 --> 00:54:58.648
- Oh, shit.
- Are you okay?

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.054
Yeah, it's just wet.
Oh, shit.

00:55:03.356 --> 00:55:05.125
Okay, here I go.

00:55:06.927 --> 00:55:10.894
Hey, what about the radio?
Maybe it'll shut the music off.

00:55:10.896 --> 00:55:12.432
No, I don't think
it's connected.

00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:16.601
What about those coolers
at the top?

00:55:16.603 --> 00:55:17.901
Okay.

00:55:17.903 --> 00:55:19.737
Maybe the handle's in there.

00:55:19.739 --> 00:55:21.807
And keep your eyes
peeled for that eight ball.

00:55:21.809 --> 00:55:22.809
Okay.

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:28.045
Yeah, the craftsmanship
in here is just terrifying.

00:55:28.047 --> 00:55:30.081
I hate this room so much.

00:55:30.083 --> 00:55:31.318
Guys, I've got a lock box.

00:55:33.954 --> 00:55:35.088
All right.

00:55:36.456 --> 00:55:38.623
It looks like
I need four numbers.

00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:41.425
All right, try
one-two-three-four. Just to see.

00:55:41.427 --> 00:55:43.760
I guess we know
Mike's PIN code.

00:55:47.266 --> 00:55:48.900
Nope.

00:55:48.902 --> 00:55:51.034
All right.
Try one-one-one-one.

00:55:51.036 --> 00:55:52.603
You know, go back
to the basics.

00:55:52.605 --> 00:55:54.574
What? One-one-one-one?

00:55:55.742 --> 00:55:57.775
Uh, nope. That's not it.

00:55:57.777 --> 00:55:59.913
It's a giant sliding puzzle.

00:56:02.949 --> 00:56:04.148
- Zo?
- Zoey?

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:05.918
- Zoey, what are you doing?
- Zo?

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.923
Careful.
Careful, careful, careful.

00:56:23.503 --> 00:56:25.202
Good job, Zo.

00:56:25.204 --> 00:56:27.170
That's good, Zoey.
Just stay there.

00:56:27.172 --> 00:56:28.639
Where are you going?

00:56:28.641 --> 00:56:30.911
I can't hang around
on this bookshelf all day.

00:56:35.148 --> 00:56:38.251
This was a bad idea.
Oh, God.

00:56:40.653 --> 00:56:42.686
Come on.
One, two, three.

00:56:44.556 --> 00:56:46.724
Up you get.

00:56:46.726 --> 00:56:47.891
Thanks.

00:56:47.893 --> 00:56:49.195
Okay.

00:57:04.643 --> 00:57:05.943
Oh, shit!

00:57:05.945 --> 00:57:08.878
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.648
Jason, hold on!

00:57:12.217 --> 00:57:16.119
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Oh, God. I'm okay. Oh, God.

00:57:16.121 --> 00:57:17.487
Are you all right?

00:57:17.489 --> 00:57:20.891
Keep going. Keep going.
I'm okay.

00:57:20.893 --> 00:57:22.894
He's okay.
It's okay, he's okay.

00:57:22.896 --> 00:57:24.765
You've got this.
You've got this.

00:57:29.369 --> 00:57:32.606
Is there anything we can do
about this shitty music?

00:57:39.079 --> 00:57:40.412
Oh, God!

00:57:40.414 --> 00:57:41.679
Oh, my God.

00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:43.383
Jesus Christ.

00:57:50.956 --> 00:57:52.555
Hey, I've got it.

00:57:52.557 --> 00:57:53.793
What?

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.061
Got it.

00:57:57.063 --> 00:58:00.764
There are colors.
I see yellow...

00:58:00.766 --> 00:58:03.066
black, and blue.

00:58:03.068 --> 00:58:06.604
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and we've
got two lines and a circle.

00:58:06.606 --> 00:58:09.840
It's like Morse code.
Maybe it's Morse code.

00:58:09.842 --> 00:58:12.744
Stripes and circles.
They're billiard balls.

00:58:12.746 --> 00:58:14.945
The yellow stripe,
that's a nine.

00:58:14.947 --> 00:58:16.514
Nine. Next.

00:58:16.516 --> 00:58:19.217
The black ball, like, that's
the eight ball, obviously.

00:58:19.219 --> 00:58:21.219
- Eight. Two more.
- Blue stripe, that's ten.

00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:22.686
Try one-zero.

00:58:22.688 --> 00:58:26.624
One-zero. Goddamn it.

00:58:26.626 --> 00:58:28.726
- Shit.
- Shit!

00:58:28.728 --> 00:58:30.864
- Go, go, go.
- Get off the floor.

00:58:36.103 --> 00:58:38.769
You've got it, Mike.
Come on.

00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:40.003
Oh, my God.

00:58:44.443 --> 00:58:45.742
Hold on, okay?

00:58:47.413 --> 00:58:49.512
That thing's not going to hold
all three of you.

00:58:49.514 --> 00:58:51.514
- Mike, climb off.
- And go where?

00:58:51.516 --> 00:58:53.617
- Use that rack on your right.
- Here, here.

00:58:53.619 --> 00:58:55.619
Guys, just hang on, okay?

00:58:55.621 --> 00:58:57.487
Oh, shit, I can't. I can't.

00:58:57.489 --> 00:58:59.824
Mike, look at me.
Get off the goddamn shelf

00:58:59.826 --> 00:59:01.425
before you get
everybody killed.

00:59:01.427 --> 00:59:02.927
Mike, man up.

00:59:02.929 --> 00:59:05.595
Stop yelling at him,
okay? Stop.

00:59:05.597 --> 00:59:08.633
Mike, I'll move. I can move,
okay? Just stay there.

00:59:08.635 --> 00:59:10.501
Just stay there.
Don't worry about it.

00:59:10.503 --> 00:59:11.635
Just go, go.

00:59:11.637 --> 00:59:14.171
Zoey. Hey,
give me your hand.

00:59:14.173 --> 00:59:15.773
Come on,
give me your hand.

00:59:15.775 --> 00:59:18.675
- Zoey, hey. Come on.
- Careful.

00:59:18.677 --> 00:59:21.177
Come on, give me your hand.
Zoey. Zoey!

00:59:21.179 --> 00:59:22.782
Zoey. Hey, Zoey.

00:59:26.152 --> 00:59:27.383
Oh, God!

00:59:27.385 --> 00:59:28.952
- Goddamn it!
- Zoey!

00:59:28.954 --> 00:59:31.322
You've got to get up.
Come on.

00:59:31.324 --> 00:59:33.624
Zoey, wake up.
Zoey, get off the floor.

00:59:33.626 --> 00:59:38.028
Zoey, stay with me. Hey, you
guys come on, I'll go get her.

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.032
Come in, Vietnam Air 109.

00:59:41.034 --> 00:59:43.633
Come in, Vietnam Air 109.

00:59:43.635 --> 00:59:46.237
Mom. Mom. Mom.

00:59:46.239 --> 00:59:49.039
Mom. Mom. Mom.

00:59:49.041 --> 00:59:50.909
Mama. Mom!

00:59:50.911 --> 00:59:53.209
Zoey, come on, wake up.

00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:55.512
Zoey, wake up.
Zoey, come on.

00:59:55.514 --> 00:59:57.046
We've got to go.
Zoey, come on!

00:59:57.048 --> 00:59:58.883
We're upside down.

00:59:58.885 --> 01:00:00.617
Hey. Come on, come on.

01:00:01.987 --> 01:00:03.521
Hey, go, go.

01:00:03.523 --> 01:00:06.055
The room is upside down,
so the code might be, too.

01:00:06.057 --> 01:00:07.494
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:13.296
Try zero-one-eight-six.

01:00:13.298 --> 01:00:16.367
Zero-one-eight-six.

01:00:18.371 --> 01:00:20.537
- I've got it.
- Okay, we've got it. Come on.

01:00:20.539 --> 01:00:22.373
- Zoey, you're a genius.
- Come on, hurry up.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:24.008
Come on, Ben,
hurry up. Hurry up.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.575
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Okay.

01:00:25.577 --> 01:00:27.043
Come on,
the floor's going to drop.

01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:31.381
That is the second time
this floor has tried to kill me.

01:00:32.885 --> 01:00:33.920
Shit.

01:00:35.889 --> 01:00:38.021
Come on, Jason.

01:00:38.023 --> 01:00:39.226
I've got it.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.661
Okay.

01:00:49.367 --> 01:00:50.636
Okay.

01:00:56.543 --> 01:00:58.411
- Okay.
- Amanda, be careful.

01:01:01.914 --> 01:01:03.213
Hang on. Hang on.

01:01:03.215 --> 01:01:04.949
All right, you've got this.

01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:06.820
Yes. Yes.

01:01:08.286 --> 01:01:10.554
- All right.
- No, don't look down.

01:01:10.556 --> 01:01:11.791
Okay.

01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:17.762
Okay.

01:01:21.967 --> 01:01:23.302
You've got it.
You've got it.

01:01:25.538 --> 01:01:26.907
Okay.

01:01:32.911 --> 01:01:34.346
Come on. Come on.

01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:38.949
- Okay.
- Shit. Oh, no.

01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:40.150
Okay.

01:01:41.487 --> 01:01:43.320
- The ball!
- No!

01:01:43.322 --> 01:01:44.854
Just let it go!

01:01:44.856 --> 01:01:47.090
- Just leave it.
- Hey, stop, stop!

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:53.831
- Just leave it.
- Amanda!

01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:55.099
No!

01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:57.101
Oh, shit!

01:01:57.103 --> 01:01:58.371
Jason!

01:01:59.706 --> 01:02:01.204
- I got it. The cord!
- Jump!

01:02:02.775 --> 01:02:04.075
Hey, give me
the pool cue.

01:02:04.077 --> 01:02:06.075
Yeah, good idea. Hang on.

01:02:06.077 --> 01:02:08.112
Hang on, Amanda. Hang on.
Come on, reach out there.

01:02:08.114 --> 01:02:10.315
- Grab on to this, come on!
- Grab it.

01:02:10.317 --> 01:02:13.416
I can't get it any farther.

01:02:13.418 --> 01:02:14.751
Hey, you can do it.

01:02:14.753 --> 01:02:16.854
You can do it.
You can do it, Amanda.

01:02:16.856 --> 01:02:18.856
You can do this.
Just grab it, okay?

01:02:18.858 --> 01:02:20.657
Grab on to it!

01:02:20.659 --> 01:02:23.126
Come on, you got this.
It's just right there.

01:02:23.128 --> 01:02:25.295
Amanda, listen to me.
You can do it.

01:02:25.297 --> 01:02:28.465
You can do this. We're
right here. Okay? Stay. No.

01:02:28.467 --> 01:02:30.032
It's okay.

01:02:30.034 --> 01:02:33.637
Amanda! No, stay, okay?
Just hold on, just hold on. No!

01:02:33.639 --> 01:02:36.074
No!

01:02:36.076 --> 01:02:39.476
No, no, no! No, no!

01:02:39.478 --> 01:02:41.181
No, Amanda, no, no!

01:03:11.643 --> 01:03:14.177
Zoey, come on.
Hey, come on. Get out!

01:03:14.179 --> 01:03:15.281
No.

01:03:41.407 --> 01:03:43.641
What in the hell
is this supposed to be?

01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:53.818
I don't see a way out.
Do you see anything?

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.121
Hey, wunderkind, I need
your brain. Get in here.

01:03:57.123 --> 01:03:58.789
Zoey!

01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:01.992
Will you give her a minute?
Amanda just died!

01:04:01.994 --> 01:04:03.927
What don't you
people understand?

01:04:03.929 --> 01:04:05.496
We don't have minutes to waste.

01:04:05.498 --> 01:04:08.231
Amanda is dead.
We aren't.

01:04:08.233 --> 01:04:09.800
Survival of the fittest.

01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:11.635
Will you stop being a dick?

01:04:11.637 --> 01:04:13.304
What is your problem?

01:04:13.306 --> 01:04:17.307
Amanda wasn't weak, okay?
She sacrificed herself for us!

01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:19.642
Okay, well, then let's
not waste that sacrifice

01:04:19.644 --> 01:04:21.246
by getting yourself killed.

01:04:49.876 --> 01:04:51.978
This was my room.

01:05:28.614 --> 01:05:30.447
Exactly the same.

01:05:30.449 --> 01:05:32.450
This is my bed.

01:05:32.452 --> 01:05:33.987
Me, too.

01:05:49.702 --> 01:05:51.371
It's Amanda's.

01:05:55.507 --> 01:05:56.708
IED blast.

01:05:58.244 --> 01:05:59.879
She was the only survivor.

01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:04.680
I was on a plane
with my mom...

01:06:04.682 --> 01:06:07.684
backpacking across
Vietnam.

01:06:07.686 --> 01:06:12.423
The plane just crashed
in the middle of the jungle.

01:06:12.425 --> 01:06:14.858
It took them a week
to find me.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.596
I remember that.

01:06:18.329 --> 01:06:20.266
You were on the news.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.434
My college roommate
and I took a boat out...

01:06:24.436 --> 01:06:26.438
and a wave came out of nowhere
and just...

01:06:27.572 --> 01:06:29.241
flipped the boat over.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:33.880
And I tried to grab
a line and, uh...

01:06:35.447 --> 01:06:37.416
almost took my thumb off.

01:06:39.085 --> 01:06:40.851
Wet...

01:06:40.853 --> 01:06:45.054
freezing,
just holding on to the hull...

01:06:45.056 --> 01:06:48.624
with only one jacket
between the two of us.

01:06:48.626 --> 01:06:54.231
And Nathan, he started getting
aggressive and confused.

01:06:54.233 --> 01:06:56.133
It was signs of hypothermia,

01:06:56.135 --> 01:06:57.834
they told me later
in the hospital.

01:06:57.836 --> 01:06:59.237
Nathan, come back!

01:06:59.239 --> 01:07:00.970
On the second day,
he swam off.

01:07:00.972 --> 01:07:03.606
I don't know what he thought
he saw out there...

01:07:03.608 --> 01:07:05.976
but there was
nothing but ocean.

01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:11.150
The next day,
the Coast Guard found me alone.

01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:13.853
What about you?

01:07:16.155 --> 01:07:18.691
I was the first of
my friends to get a car.

01:07:22.827 --> 01:07:26.262
It was winter break
and we were having this...

01:07:26.264 --> 01:07:28.268
great night and...

01:07:30.603 --> 01:07:33.606
I wanted to take everybody out
on a joy ride.

01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:40.010
I was wasted.

01:07:42.114 --> 01:07:46.983
Me and 11 others were working
a mine in West Virginia...

01:07:46.985 --> 01:07:48.554
including
my little brother, Cal.

01:07:50.989 --> 01:07:55.025
There was a cave-in.
Occupational hazard.

01:07:55.027 --> 01:07:59.662
Me and Cal got pinned
right next to each other.

01:07:59.664 --> 01:08:01.867
I couldn't see him,
but I could, uh...

01:08:03.369 --> 01:08:06.673
I could hear him
suffocating slowly.

01:08:08.373 --> 01:08:10.242
I heard him
take his last breath.

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:13.577
By the time
the rescue crew got there,

01:08:13.579 --> 01:08:16.012
I was the only one alive.

01:08:16.014 --> 01:08:20.483
They knew everything
about us...

01:08:20.485 --> 01:08:24.388
every goddamn detail.
I mean, they knew the jacket...

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.490
that my roommate was wearing
on that boat.

01:08:26.492 --> 01:08:28.858
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," that's the...

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.662
song that was playing
when we crashed.

01:08:31.963 --> 01:08:33.863
They made
these rooms for us.

01:08:33.865 --> 01:08:36.666
They addressed the boxes
from people that we trust.

01:08:36.668 --> 01:08:39.005
My nephew texted me,
"Have a good time."

01:08:40.572 --> 01:08:44.377
- They hacked his goddamn phone.
- It's Danny's.

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:50.781
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:53.183
Everyone in his family
was killed but him.

01:08:53.185 --> 01:08:55.419
None of us died, right?

01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:57.387
- We're sole survivors.
- So what?

01:08:57.389 --> 01:08:59.792
We're a statistical
improbability.

01:09:01.592 --> 01:09:03.393
And now they want
to see who will be

01:09:03.395 --> 01:09:05.465
the luckiest
among the lucky.

01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:12.201
Do you have the
heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu...

01:09:12.203 --> 01:09:14.237
help you become a better you?

01:09:14.239 --> 01:09:16.973
Open new doors
by testing your limits.

01:09:16.975 --> 01:09:19.543
Don't settle for
a humdrum existence.

01:09:19.545 --> 01:09:21.678
Live life to the extreme.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.680
Place your order
in the next five minutes

01:09:23.682 --> 01:09:25.949
and receive
a complimentary getaway.

01:09:25.951 --> 01:09:28.718
Okay, well,
at least we know how much time we have.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.388
Yeah, knowing exactly when I'm
going to die is a huge comfort.

01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:33.223
Do you guys not understand?

01:09:33.225 --> 01:09:35.692
They chose us to die to see
who's the last person standing.

01:09:35.694 --> 01:09:37.960
We need you on board right now,
okay? Stay with us.

01:09:37.962 --> 01:09:40.229
We can't just keep
playing by their rules.

01:09:40.231 --> 01:09:42.398
What else are we supposed to do?
They're watching us.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.470
They know every move
that we're making.

01:09:45.904 --> 01:09:47.536
They're watching us.

01:09:54.579 --> 01:09:56.349
I've got something.

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.720
Come on, come on.

01:10:03.988 --> 01:10:05.223
I got it. Here, here.

01:10:10.095 --> 01:10:12.094
Uh. Okay.
What do we have?

01:10:12.096 --> 01:10:14.632
A fist, one finger,
and two fingers. It could be...

01:10:14.634 --> 01:10:17.300
It could be zero, one, two,
right? Right? Like a code.

01:10:17.302 --> 01:10:19.469
No, no, no. It spells...

01:10:19.471 --> 01:10:23.406
E-K-G.

01:10:23.408 --> 01:10:26.076
Yeah, it's sign language.

01:10:26.078 --> 01:10:28.845
My cousin is deaf. They must
have known about that, too.

01:10:28.847 --> 01:10:30.813
Is there an EKG machine
here somewhere?

01:10:32.851 --> 01:10:34.817
Hey, what are you doing?

01:10:34.819 --> 01:10:36.754
Quantum Zeno effect.
Atoms won't change

01:10:36.756 --> 01:10:38.621
if you take
continuous measurements...

01:10:38.623 --> 01:10:40.290
so as long as
they're watching us,

01:10:40.292 --> 01:10:41.692
we can't change our state.

01:10:41.694 --> 01:10:43.660
The game is designed
so they always win.

01:10:47.099 --> 01:10:49.665
Okay, okay. We could really use
your help right now.

01:10:49.667 --> 01:10:51.468
No. We can find
another way out.

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:52.870
We don't even
know the first way out.

01:10:52.872 --> 01:10:55.205
Just stop smashing shit
and take a deep breath.

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:57.374
Do you have the
heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu

01:10:57.376 --> 01:10:59.476
help you
become a better you?

01:10:59.478 --> 01:11:02.044
Hey, Zoey,
you need to calm down.

01:11:04.315 --> 01:11:06.516
In three minutes,
they're going to poison us.

01:11:06.518 --> 01:11:08.518
We are running out of time here.
You've got to calm down.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.254
Stop telling me
to calm down, okay?

01:11:10.256 --> 01:11:12.222
You're not listening to me!

01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:17.059
You guys, it's an EKG machine.
Maybe this is our way out.

01:11:17.061 --> 01:11:19.996
- Ben, take your shirt off.
- What? Why me?

01:11:19.998 --> 01:11:21.897
Because it's the next clue,
that's why.

01:11:21.899 --> 01:11:23.567
Come on, it's just
an EKG machine.

01:11:23.569 --> 01:11:26.669
No, no. Nothing is just anything
in this hellhole.

01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:28.505
The right heart rate
could open a door, Ben.

01:11:28.507 --> 01:11:31.340
- We're running out of time.
- Hurry up.

01:11:31.342 --> 01:11:32.342
Just do it. Come on.

01:11:36.081 --> 01:11:39.250
Come on. Hold those, hold those.
Take a breath, take a breath.

01:11:42.654 --> 01:11:46.388
Your heart rate's too low.
Your heart rate's too low.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:48.924
It's not working.

01:11:48.926 --> 01:11:50.393
Somebody else
has to do it.

01:11:50.395 --> 01:11:52.862
Mike, we need a higher rate.
You've got to go.

01:11:52.864 --> 01:11:56.200
What? I'm not your guinea pig,
man. You do it. You try it.

01:11:56.202 --> 01:11:57.767
Look. Ben is fine,
man. Come on,

01:11:57.769 --> 01:11:59.969
I'll go next. We need
a higher rate. Come on.

01:11:59.971 --> 01:12:01.972
All right. Okay.
All right, let's do it.

01:12:01.974 --> 01:12:04.342
Zoey, please, just listen to me
for two seconds.

01:12:06.744 --> 01:12:08.146
Shit.

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.684
We're in a metal box. Come on,
that's not going to help.

01:12:15.387 --> 01:12:18.054
Just stop smashing shit
and help me.

01:12:18.056 --> 01:12:20.389
Higher, higher, higher.
Come on!

01:12:20.391 --> 01:12:22.326
No.

01:12:22.328 --> 01:12:24.428
Open new doors by
testing your limits.

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:26.597
Testing your limits.
Testing your limits.

01:12:26.599 --> 01:12:27.964
- We need a higher rate.
- You're kidding me.

01:12:27.966 --> 01:12:29.066
Man, I'm already
freaking out here.

01:12:29.068 --> 01:12:30.599
My heart rate's sky high.

01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:32.134
Want me to do some
burpees, jumping jacks?

01:12:32.136 --> 01:12:33.469
What do you want me to do?

01:12:33.471 --> 01:12:35.507
- We've got these.
- What are you, insane?

01:12:37.208 --> 01:12:39.709
When the Coast Guard found me
dying from hypothermia...

01:12:39.711 --> 01:12:41.111
my heart was half dead, man.

01:12:41.113 --> 01:12:42.745
These are what they used
to bring me back.

01:12:42.747 --> 01:12:43.946
Come on, this
is what they used.

01:12:43.948 --> 01:12:45.449
No, no.
That is not an option.

01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:47.217
Listen, it is a clue.
They put it in my room

01:12:47.219 --> 01:12:48.818
because they knew
I would know, Mike.

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.987
Your heart's already high.
Man up, come on.

01:12:50.989 --> 01:12:52.656
Are you kidding me?
Get these away from me.

01:12:52.658 --> 01:12:55.326
Look at me, goddamn it!
Look at me!

01:12:55.328 --> 01:12:57.695
In one minute,
they're about to poison us.

01:12:57.697 --> 01:12:59.696
And we are going to
suffocate, all right?

01:12:59.698 --> 01:13:01.432
We're going to run out
of breathable air,

01:13:01.434 --> 01:13:02.465
just like you did
in that mine.

01:13:02.467 --> 01:13:03.666
Shit.

01:13:03.668 --> 01:13:05.335
You think about
your brother, Cal.

01:13:05.337 --> 01:13:09.606
Cal was his name, right?
This is your time.

01:13:09.608 --> 01:13:11.310
Mike, you can save us.

01:13:13.179 --> 01:13:16.012
This is it.
You could save us, Mike.

01:13:16.014 --> 01:13:17.946
- Now, save us.
- Okay.

01:13:17.948 --> 01:13:20.950
Do it. Do it, do it quick!
Come on, do it!

01:13:25.724 --> 01:13:27.022
- Jason, what are you doing?
- That's it.

01:13:27.024 --> 01:13:29.291
No. No.

01:13:29.293 --> 01:13:32.361
- Hey, don't. Stop!
- Get off me!

01:13:35.934 --> 01:13:37.200
You're going to kill him!

01:13:37.202 --> 01:13:39.436
Come on!

01:13:39.438 --> 01:13:41.938
Mike? What did you do?

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:44.507
He stopped breathing!
Mike!

01:13:44.509 --> 01:13:48.678
Wake up! Mike.
Hey, stop! Stop!

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.280
Come on!

01:13:50.282 --> 01:13:52.616
Come on, Mike!

01:13:52.618 --> 01:13:54.851
Open new doors by
testing your limits.

01:13:54.853 --> 01:13:56.019
Testing your limits.

01:14:01.659 --> 01:14:03.559
High and low. High and low.

01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:06.431
One, two.
Goddamn it. Fuck!

01:14:10.034 --> 01:14:11.034
Oh, shit.

01:14:12.337 --> 01:14:14.072
I don't actually know
how to do this.

01:14:16.341 --> 01:14:17.741
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:17.743 --> 01:14:20.146
Extremes.
Maybe they mean the low end.

01:14:28.087 --> 01:14:29.452
Hey, come on.

01:14:45.436 --> 01:14:46.805
Come on, man.

01:14:47.773 --> 01:14:50.440
Come on. Shit.

01:14:50.442 --> 01:14:51.442
Mike.

01:14:53.412 --> 01:14:54.480
Mike.

01:15:01.752 --> 01:15:04.523
The door. The door
is opening. It opened.

01:15:10.996 --> 01:15:12.431
Zoey. Hey!

01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:14.331
Zoey!

01:15:15.934 --> 01:15:18.968
Zoey! Hey, come on.
There's a way out.

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.237
This is the way out.

01:15:21.239 --> 01:15:23.305
You'll suffocate,
come on!

01:15:23.307 --> 01:15:24.307
Just go!

01:15:26.444 --> 01:15:27.880
- Please!
- Just go!

01:15:37.988 --> 01:15:39.789
Shit.

01:16:14.827 --> 01:16:16.595
We should have made her
come with us.

01:16:19.497 --> 01:16:21.798
We just left her there to die.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.032
She made her decision.

01:16:23.034 --> 01:16:25.201
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:16:25.203 --> 01:16:26.803
What happened back there?

01:16:26.805 --> 01:16:29.508
I saved our asses.
You're welcome.

01:16:30.675 --> 01:16:32.211
You killed Mike.

01:16:35.514 --> 01:16:39.449
Sitting on his ass
12 hours a day killed him.

01:16:39.451 --> 01:16:42.354
If it wasn't that room,
it would've been the next.

01:16:45.523 --> 01:16:47.656
So that's just something
you do, isn't it?

01:16:47.658 --> 01:16:48.958
Your friend on the boat?

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.197
What are you saying,
Ben? Huh?

01:16:54.666 --> 01:16:56.799
Use your words.

01:16:56.801 --> 01:16:59.568
One jacket
between the two of you.

01:16:59.570 --> 01:17:01.204
Give me your jacket!

01:17:01.206 --> 01:17:04.409
It's pretty convenient
that he just swam off and died.

01:17:06.344 --> 01:17:08.710
You don't want
to do this, man.

01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:11.951
You being the sole survivor
had nothing to do with luck.

01:17:13.618 --> 01:17:15.184
Admit it.

01:17:15.186 --> 01:17:18.157
You killed him! Admit that
you killed your friend.

01:17:20.257 --> 01:17:22.060
Surviving is a choice!

01:17:23.895 --> 01:17:25.765
Make yours.

01:17:30.234 --> 01:17:32.904
Keep your eyes open
and look for clues.

01:17:35.407 --> 01:17:37.909
Hey, it's a hatch.

01:17:41.913 --> 01:17:44.113
I guess
we just open it.

01:17:44.115 --> 01:17:45.917
What are we letting in?

01:17:48.086 --> 01:17:49.488
Fine, I'll do it.

01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:53.156
- It's heavy.
- Come on, try harder.

01:17:53.158 --> 01:17:55.157
Asshole, I don't go
to the gym every day.

01:17:55.159 --> 01:17:56.595
Goddamn it.

01:18:05.002 --> 01:18:06.671
Come on, come on.

01:18:12.543 --> 01:18:14.710
What's this shit on my hands?

01:18:21.752 --> 01:18:23.655
I don't feel so good.

01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:27.958
Hey, hey.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.628
They put something
on the handle.

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:35.632
Hey, you're melting.
You're melting.

01:18:35.634 --> 01:18:38.067
- What?
- You're melting.

01:18:38.069 --> 01:18:41.504
What? Wait. Look, look.
It says something.

01:18:41.506 --> 01:18:45.575
"Feel free to leave,
but may we note...

01:18:45.577 --> 01:18:49.012
it's best to
find the antidote."

01:18:49.014 --> 01:18:51.615
How the hell are
we supposed to do that?

01:19:00.492 --> 01:19:02.258
Get up and look,
goddamn it!

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:05.528
Who cares, man?
We're going to die here anyway.

01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:07.964
I'm not going to die.
I'm not going to die.

01:19:16.541 --> 01:19:18.007
Okay.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.214
Where is it? Come on.
Come on. Where is it?

01:19:25.216 --> 01:19:28.286
- Where is this bastard?
- Where is it?

01:19:34.826 --> 01:19:36.595
Ben. Ben.

01:19:40.765 --> 01:19:42.898
- I have the anti...
- Give me that!

01:19:59.684 --> 01:20:01.220
It's mine!

01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:42.058
Shit.

01:20:47.698 --> 01:20:49.467
Oh, shit.

01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:10.521
Oh, my God.

01:21:13.125 --> 01:21:15.991
Okay, I've got ten numbers,
four spots.

01:21:15.993 --> 01:21:17.593
I need a four-digit code.

01:21:21.131 --> 01:21:23.465
Entering room five.
Stand by.

01:21:23.467 --> 01:21:25.768
Standing by.

01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:28.007
We have two bodies. Over.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.809
Copy.

01:21:32.711 --> 01:21:36.512
20 minutes for disposal
and cleanup. Over.

01:21:36.514 --> 01:21:38.317
Copy. Out.

01:21:42.453 --> 01:21:44.888
Look at that,
the oxygen mask.

01:21:44.890 --> 01:21:47.055
What the hell was she going
to do with that?

01:21:47.057 --> 01:21:48.657
Breathe, bitch!

01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:14.150
Shit.

01:23:17.414 --> 01:23:20.049
Now, you were a dark horse.

01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:21.884
My money was on Jason.

01:23:21.886 --> 01:23:24.754
But, see, that's why these
games are so fascinating.

01:23:24.756 --> 01:23:26.589
Somehow, after being burnt,

01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:28.958
frozen, poisoned,
and crippled...

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.562
you still managed
to escape the final room.

01:23:32.564 --> 01:23:35.231
Did you ever think
you had that in you?

01:23:35.233 --> 01:23:38.604
That adrenaline,
that drive?

01:23:39.637 --> 01:23:42.405
Sit down. Celebrate.

01:23:42.407 --> 01:23:45.144
You won
something for once.

01:23:46.944 --> 01:23:49.812
So, you're the psycho that
designed this murder maze, huh?

01:23:49.814 --> 01:23:52.147
No, I'm the Games Master.

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:54.416
The Puzzle Maker
designs the rooms.

01:23:54.418 --> 01:23:58.222
But you kill people for fun.
There's nothing good left on TV?

01:23:59.457 --> 01:24:01.458
You killed all your friends...

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.860
because you didn't want to pay
for a goddamn cab.

01:24:03.862 --> 01:24:07.095
I wouldn't get too comfortable
on that high horse, Ben.

01:24:07.097 --> 01:24:08.930
From the beginning
of civilization...

01:24:08.932 --> 01:24:11.166
we've known there
was something captivating...

01:24:11.168 --> 01:24:13.669
about watching human beings
fight for their lives.

01:24:13.671 --> 01:24:17.305
That's why we watch gladiator
games, public executions...

01:24:17.307 --> 01:24:19.208
rubber-necking
on the freeway.

01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:20.677
But now
the world's gone soft.

01:24:20.679 --> 01:24:23.679
Everything is safe.
Everything is careful.

01:24:23.681 --> 01:24:25.615
So, we created a sport
for people

01:24:25.617 --> 01:24:27.851
who still have
a thirst for savagery...

01:24:27.853 --> 01:24:30.486
and we provided them
with a box seat

01:24:30.488 --> 01:24:32.324
for life's ultimate drama.

01:24:36.927 --> 01:24:39.428
Our customers are some
of the most powerful

01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:41.531
people in the world.

01:24:41.533 --> 01:24:44.634
But every year,
they demand more.

01:24:44.636 --> 01:24:48.137
More complicated rooms.

01:24:48.139 --> 01:24:50.005
More interesting subjects.

01:24:50.007 --> 01:24:53.308
More ways to gamble on
life and death.

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:57.312
Last year,
they had college athletes...

01:24:57.314 --> 01:24:59.315
the year before,
savants...

01:24:59.317 --> 01:25:02.218
and this year
we had lone survivors.

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:06.022
They wanted to know if luck
had anything to do with it.

01:25:06.024 --> 01:25:10.992
Lucky people don't get kidnapped
and tortured by psychopaths.

01:25:10.994 --> 01:25:12.727
You know,
it's kind of hurtful

01:25:12.729 --> 01:25:14.599
when you call someone
a psychopath, huh?

01:25:18.837 --> 01:25:21.070
I thought it was stupid, too.

01:25:21.072 --> 01:25:22.804
But here you are...

01:25:22.806 --> 01:25:25.376
our lowest-odds ever to win...

01:25:26.877 --> 01:25:29.178
still alive.

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:32.447
I really didn't think
it was possible...

01:25:32.449 --> 01:25:33.883
but as I said...

01:25:33.885 --> 01:25:35.253
you were the long shot.

01:25:41.059 --> 01:25:43.427
So I won.

01:25:44.729 --> 01:25:47.099
That means I get
to go home, right?

01:25:52.037 --> 01:25:54.135
Ben...

01:25:54.137 --> 01:25:56.205
at the end of
the Kentucky Derby...

01:25:56.207 --> 01:25:58.310
do you think
the horse gets a prize?

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.952
Shh...

01:26:10.954 --> 01:26:12.356
Shh, shh...

01:26:31.208 --> 01:26:33.409
Hey. Hey, Ben.

01:26:33.411 --> 01:26:36.581
Come on. Hey, Ben,
come on. Come on.

01:26:51.595 --> 01:26:53.662
Ben.

01:26:53.664 --> 01:26:56.232
Ben.

01:26:56.234 --> 01:26:59.168
Ben, come on, get up.
Ben, come on, get up.

01:27:00.971 --> 01:27:02.273
No!

01:27:08.179 --> 01:27:12.113
You can't leave until
we finish our game, Zoey.

01:27:20.158 --> 01:27:22.894
Okay, we have
to make sure that...

01:27:25.829 --> 01:27:27.399
He's dead.

01:27:37.809 --> 01:27:40.177
Okay. Come on.
Come on.

01:27:41.578 --> 01:27:43.547
Come on,
there's a service elevator.

01:27:48.152 --> 01:27:50.585
You came back for me.

01:27:50.587 --> 01:27:53.625
Yeah, well, I'm tired
of being the only survivor.

01:27:57.528 --> 01:28:00.198
- Zoey, go, go.
- Okay.

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:12.607
It's been 24 hours.
He's stable now.

01:28:12.609 --> 01:28:14.378
You should get some rest.

01:28:16.547 --> 01:28:18.380
He's ready.

01:28:18.382 --> 01:28:20.583
Dr. Bell,
please come to the OR.

01:28:20.585 --> 01:28:21.987
Dr. Bell, OR, please.

01:28:23.354 --> 01:28:25.254
Miss Davis?

01:28:25.256 --> 01:28:27.592
Are you feeling well enough
to come with me?

01:28:30.929 --> 01:28:34.496
Yeah, you're right, we'll have
to check that for roof access.

01:28:47.011 --> 01:28:49.614
All right, everyone, 360.

01:28:51.349 --> 01:28:52.784
Miss Davis.

01:29:02.226 --> 01:29:06.062
Wait, this was
the waiting room. Okay?

01:29:06.064 --> 01:29:09.031
And then it turned
into a giant oven, okay?

01:29:09.033 --> 01:29:12.468
And there was fire. The fire
came down from the ceiling.

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:15.974
We haven't found any evidence
of the things you've described.

01:29:17.207 --> 01:29:20.108
That. Look.
This was the duct.

01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:22.044
There was a painting
that came down.

01:29:22.046 --> 01:29:24.612
Have you ever seen things
that weren't there before?

01:29:24.614 --> 01:29:28.483
I am not imagining
this, okay?

01:29:28.485 --> 01:29:30.452
Look, Ben was there, too.

01:29:30.454 --> 01:29:32.589
He'll tell you all this
when he wakes up.

01:29:32.591 --> 01:29:35.290
Right.
Your friend, Ben Miller?

01:29:35.292 --> 01:29:37.427
We got a report
from the hospital.

01:29:37.429 --> 01:29:39.195
They found traces
of three different

01:29:39.197 --> 01:29:42.498
illegal substances
in his bloodstream.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.034
"No way out."

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:49.338
- Miss Davis.
- It's an anagram.

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.674
Dr. Wootan Yu.

01:29:51.676 --> 01:29:54.876
Do you have the heart
to let Dr. Wootan Yu help you...

01:29:54.878 --> 01:29:56.478
No way out. Wootan Yu.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.882
- "Wootan Yu" is "No way out."
- Miss Davis.

01:29:59.884 --> 01:30:01.683
No way out, Wootan Yu.

01:30:01.685 --> 01:30:06.321
This. Look.
That was a part of the game.

01:30:06.323 --> 01:30:09.023
This is part of the game!

01:30:09.025 --> 01:30:10.996
We've got to vacate
the premises.

01:30:20.136 --> 01:30:23.705
Wootan Yu. Wootan Yu.

01:30:40.457 --> 01:30:41.857
Thank you.

01:30:43.293 --> 01:30:45.794
So, are you going to tell me
what's going on?

01:30:45.796 --> 01:30:49.632
I am the new regional sales rep
for all of Logan Square.

01:30:49.634 --> 01:30:52.535
I'm officially client facing.
It's for vegan dog food...

01:30:52.537 --> 01:30:54.736
but, you know,
you've got to start somewhere.

01:30:54.738 --> 01:30:56.674
I'm really proud of you.

01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:00.710
Is that homework?

01:31:07.551 --> 01:31:09.018
What is this?

01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:11.888
Mike Nolan died of
a heart attack

01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:14.055
in a bathroom
in Union Station.

01:31:14.057 --> 01:31:17.927
Jason Walker was thrown
from his bike on the I-64...

01:31:17.929 --> 01:31:19.530
DMT found in his system.

01:31:20.898 --> 01:31:23.232
Danny Khan
drowns in Lake Michigan.

01:31:23.234 --> 01:31:25.335
Amanda Harper,
rock-climbing alone,

01:31:25.337 --> 01:31:27.835
because that makes sense...

01:31:27.837 --> 01:31:29.940
falls and dies.

01:31:31.375 --> 01:31:34.110
There would have been
articles for us, too.

01:31:34.112 --> 01:31:35.710
You've got to
let this shit go.

01:31:35.712 --> 01:31:39.248
I can't just pretend
that they never existed.

01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:41.817
Everyone else who was sent
those invitations died...

01:31:41.819 --> 01:31:44.620
and whoever sent them
is still out there.

01:31:44.622 --> 01:31:47.990
Don't you want answers?
We can find them.

01:31:47.992 --> 01:31:51.226
They rigged the game so
that we would lose and we won.

01:31:51.228 --> 01:31:54.597
We beat them
at their own game.

01:31:54.599 --> 01:31:56.467
I didn't have a lot
to go on, but...

01:31:58.168 --> 01:32:00.335
the logo...

01:32:00.337 --> 01:32:02.838
it's an impossible object.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.273
It's an Escher staircase
that turns in on itself.

01:32:05.275 --> 01:32:07.409
It's totally unique.

01:32:07.411 --> 01:32:10.678
The numbers are in a pattern
on the staircase.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:14.849
23, 22 in a repeated sequence
of right angles.

01:32:14.851 --> 01:32:16.852
They're coordinates...

01:32:16.854 --> 01:32:18.653
for an unlisted
industrial building

01:32:18.655 --> 01:32:19.988
in the middle
of Manhattan.

01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:21.456
They're hiding
in plain sight.

01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:24.192
What are we supposed
to do with that?

01:32:24.194 --> 01:32:27.495
- I bought us plane tickets.
- Plane tickets?

01:32:27.497 --> 01:32:29.031
Two weeks, I'm going.

01:32:29.033 --> 01:32:32.101
Zoey, it's called
"survivor's guilt."

01:32:32.103 --> 01:32:35.804
My therapist says that in order
to live, you need to move on.

01:32:35.806 --> 01:32:39.141
Moving on
doesn't mean running.

01:32:39.143 --> 01:32:42.245
And I'm done running.
Are you in?

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:46.315
All right.

01:32:46.317 --> 01:32:49.119
Yeah, I'm in.
Let's do it.

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.823
You're not Jason Bourne,
though.

01:32:55.525 --> 01:32:57.826
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:04.465
Come on.
It's got to be in here.

01:33:09.841 --> 01:33:13.375
Found it!
X marks the spot.

01:33:13.377 --> 01:33:15.013
Come on, come on,
where is it?

01:33:17.282 --> 01:33:20.115
This has to be it, right?
I've got the tool!

01:33:23.453 --> 01:33:25.853
Right here. It must connect
to the bolt we found.

01:33:25.855 --> 01:33:27.156
Okay.

01:33:27.158 --> 01:33:29.357
Try it on the door.
See if it'll turn.

01:33:29.359 --> 01:33:30.494
You can do it.

01:33:32.729 --> 01:33:34.964
- Anything?
- It's not going!

01:33:34.966 --> 01:33:36.964
- See if you can turn it.
- It's not working!

01:33:36.966 --> 01:33:38.200
- Try clockwise.
- Clockwise?

01:33:38.202 --> 01:33:39.537
- Yeah, clockwise!
- Okay.

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:42.470
- Something happened here.
- What?

01:33:42.472 --> 01:33:44.139
- Terrain, terrain.
- What's this?

01:33:44.141 --> 01:33:45.574
No, it's another riddle.

01:33:45.576 --> 01:33:48.043
"I fly without wings,
I cry without eyes."

01:33:48.045 --> 01:33:50.278
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. Give me a second!

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.548
Heads down!

01:33:53.117 --> 01:33:55.418
Brace for impact!

01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.253
- Wait, "cloud"! Try "cloud"!
- "Cloud"?

01:33:57.255 --> 01:34:00.356
- Yeah, "cloud."
- Okay.

01:34:00.358 --> 01:34:02.257
Try the door!
Come on, let's go!

01:34:02.259 --> 01:34:04.527
Pull up. Caution, terrain.
Decision height.

01:34:04.529 --> 01:34:05.861
Terrain, terrain. Pull up.

01:34:05.863 --> 01:34:07.729
No, no! Come on! Come on!

01:34:07.731 --> 01:34:09.130
Caution, terrain.
Terrain, terrain.

01:34:09.132 --> 01:34:10.933
Do something!

01:34:10.935 --> 01:34:13.404
Pull up.
Decision height. Pull up.

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:20.409
Ending sim.
Do you want to reset?

01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:24.349
No.
Good work. We're ready for game time.

01:34:26.283 --> 01:34:29.585
I hurt my goddamn hand
on that bolt again, Larry.

01:34:29.587 --> 01:34:32.123
Deboard the simulator.

01:34:38.628 --> 01:34:40.896
What's the
probability of survival?

01:34:40.898 --> 01:34:43.132
It's approximately
four percent.

01:34:43.134 --> 01:34:46.968
Well, it's not a game
if she doesn't stand any chance.

01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:50.606
We've intercepted her
flight information. It's on.

01:34:50.608 --> 01:34:55.410
I'm so glad Zoey got over
her fear of flying.

01:34:55.412 --> 01:34:57.481
Let's play again.

01:35:00.821 --> 01:35:05.821
