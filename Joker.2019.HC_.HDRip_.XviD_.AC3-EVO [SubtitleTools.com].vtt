00:00:01.571 --> 00:00:03.060
The news never ends.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.650
This is tenneti GCR,

00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:07.596
you get all the news
you need, all day long.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.496
Good morning. It's 42° and
10:30 on this Thursday October 15.

00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:15.790
I'm Standale Brodston.
Here's what's happening.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:18.282
It's day eighteen of
the garbage stall,

00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:21.021
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day,

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:24.105
even the nicest sections of the
city are looking like swamps.

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:28.076
Health commissioner Edward O'Roark is
declaring a citywide state of emergency

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:29.798
for the first time in decades.

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:33.787
There's no need to wait until somebody
dies or comes down with typhoid fever.

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:35.929
It's already a serious situation.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.339
It's something that affects
almost everyone in the city,

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:40.573
no matter who they are
or where they live.

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:44.915
You can't go down no one avenue without
seeing nothing but garbage and rats.

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:49.122
It's starting to affect my business when customers
can't get in here because of garbage situation.

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:51.148
When out there, not just smell it,

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:53.068
but I think to look at it,
its terrible.

00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:57.447
It don't affect me, except for the
the very bad smell, it's horrific.

00:00:57.877 --> 00:00:58.569
The mess.

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.170
I've been in this country for 50 years
and I've never seen anything like it.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.842
What is this world coming to?

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:06.355
Put them in the room there and
sit there and talk 'till they got it over with.

00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:08.927
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:12.535
The Idea of the National Guard pulling
in and cleaning up, it's good idea!

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:15.669
In other news the Building
Industry of Landlords today

00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:18.886
expressed concern over the latest
increase in heating oil prices.

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.599
Rangers in the Metro area are
searched to fill them in...

00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:56.664
Let's get it.

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.039
- Yo, what's up with your shoes, bro?
- Nice outfit, huh?

00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:02.666
If you're gonna be a clown, at least you
can be a bill-boy, you know that, right?

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.356
- Hey!
- Stop it!

00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:07.865
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hey!

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:11.807
- Come on, Kyle, let's go!
- We've got the sign!

00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:13.250
Let's go!

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.017
- Stop there!
- Come on!

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:16.708
Watch your go!
Watch your go!

00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:20.181
Make me stop, clown.

00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:21.943
Hey!

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:28.540
C'mon clown, you are not
catching up.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.264
Stop them!

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.027
Come on!

00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:33.282
- Come on!
- Get out of the way!

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.570
Stop them!

00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:41.146
Hey!

00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:44.280
You bastards.

00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:52.702
Come on, beat his ass up.

00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.658
Come on, this guy's weak,
can't do nothing.

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:56.478
Harder! Harder!

00:02:56.534 --> 00:02:58.227
Beat him up.
Take his stuff.

00:02:58.227 --> 00:02:59.640
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, come on, come on!

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:46.478
Is it just me,

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:49.323
or is it getting crazier out there?

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:55.170
It is certainly tense.

00:04:56.782 --> 00:04:58.214
People are upset.

00:04:58.989 --> 00:04:59.998
They're struggling.

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:01.280
Looking for work.

00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:04.259
These are tough times.

00:05:06.214 --> 00:05:07.465
How 'bout you?

00:05:09.373 --> 00:05:11.117
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:14.045
Yes, Ma'am.

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.415
Great.

00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:19.762
Did you bring it with you?

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:25.604
Arthur...

00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:28.323
last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:30.044
for these appointments.

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.669
Can I see it?

00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:47.239
I've been using it as a--
as a journal,

00:05:48.576 --> 00:05:50.649
but also as a joke diary.

00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:54.813
Funny thoughts or
observations.

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:59.333
I think I told you I'm pursuing
a career in stand-up comedy.

00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:04.877
No, you didn't.

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.034
I think I did.

00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:20.172
"I just hope my death makes
more cents than my life."

00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:39.729
How does it feel to
have to come here?

00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:41.546
Does it help

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:43.164
to have someone to talk to?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.165
I think I felt better when
I was locked up in a hospital.

00:06:52.717 --> 00:06:54.311
And having thought more about

00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:56.698
why you were locked up?

00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:03.601
Who knows?

00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:14.532
I was wondering if you could ask the
doctor to increase my medication?

00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:23.024
Arthur, you're on seven
different medications.

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:26.273
Surely, they must
be doing something.

00:07:29.642 --> 00:07:31.698
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:11.877
Can you please stop
bothering my kid?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.494
- Sit!
- I wasn't bothering him...

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.012
- Just stop!
- I was...

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.284
What, you think that's funny?

00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:37.623
I'm sorry, I have a co...

00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:47.236
"It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent and
uncontrollable laughter that doesn’t match

00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.834
how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain
injury or certain neurological conditions."

00:08:53.524 --> 00:08:55.363
I'm sorry.

00:10:33.948 --> 00:10:36.857
Happy? Did you check the mail
before you came up?

00:10:36.952 --> 00:10:38.264
Yeah, mom.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.138
Nothing.

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:47.670
And finally tonight, just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse.

00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:51.400
Authorities are saying the city is
under siege by scores of rats.

00:10:51.548 --> 00:10:54.941
- And not just any rats - super rats.
- More hard to kill.

00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:57.099
He must not be
getting any of my letters.

00:10:58.335 --> 00:11:00.434
It's Thomas Wayne, mom.

00:11:00.837 --> 00:11:03.456
- He is a busy man.
- Oh, please.

00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:05.654
I worked for that
family for years.

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:07.836
The least he could do
is write back.

00:11:09.643 --> 00:11:12.528
Here, all worked up.
Eat.

00:11:12.636 --> 00:11:14.974
- You need to eat.
- You need to eat.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.713
How skinny you are.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.516
He will make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.413
Oh, yeah?
Everybody who?

00:11:29.616 --> 00:11:32.986
- Who do you talk to?
- Well, everybody on the news.

00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:35.528
He is the only one who
could save the city.

00:11:35.997 --> 00:11:37.569
He owes it to us.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.971
Come, sit. It's starting.

00:11:41.996 --> 00:11:43.911
Oh, my!

00:11:44.546 --> 00:11:48.050
From NCB studios
in Gotham city!

00:11:48.146 --> 00:11:51.085
It's Live with Murray Franklin!

00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:54.840
Tonight Murray welcomes,
Sandra Winger,

00:11:54.864 --> 00:12:00.150
comedian Skip Byron and the
piano styling of Yeldon & Chantel!

00:12:00.288 --> 00:12:02.665
Joining Murray as always,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.100
Ellis Drane and
his Jazz Orchestra.

00:12:05.118 --> 00:12:08.028
And now, without further ado,

00:12:08.053 --> 00:12:11.368
Murray Franklin!

00:12:23.324 --> 00:12:24.581
Thank you.

00:12:26.388 --> 00:12:27.878
Thank you.

00:12:28.042 --> 00:12:30.184
We've got a great
looking audience today.

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:32.282
- Yeah!
- Murray!

00:12:32.307 --> 00:12:34.309
Wow.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.378
Thank you.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.055
So, everybody's heard about the super
rats stutter in Gotham now, right?

00:12:41.306 --> 00:12:44.569
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.

00:12:44.684 --> 00:12:46.197
You ready for this?

00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:47.836
Super cats.

00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:54.753
- But no, serious it is, I mean these guys are...
- I love you, Murray!

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.062
I love you, too.

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:01.929
Hey, Bobby, will you
put the lights on?

00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:04.187
Who is that?
Was that you?

00:13:04.282 --> 00:13:05.603
You wanna stand up, please?

00:13:05.695 --> 00:13:07.392
Stand. Stand up for me.

00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:09.156
There.

00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:15.241
What's your name?

00:13:16.131 --> 00:13:18.228
Hi, Murray.
Arthur.

00:13:18.313 --> 00:13:19.804
- Arthur?
- My name is Arthur.

00:13:19.814 --> 00:13:22.738
Ah, okay, well, there is something
special about you, Arthur. I could tell.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.535
- Where are you from?
- I live right here in the city.

00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:27.183
With my m--mother.

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:31.315
Okay, hold on. Hold on.
There is nothing funny about that.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.013
I lived with my mother
before I made it. Just me and her.

00:13:34.162 --> 00:13:36.726
I'm that kid who's father went
out for a pack of cigarettes.

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:38.577
And he never came back.

00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:41.126
I know what that's like, Murray.

00:13:41.503 --> 00:13:43.968
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

00:13:44.298 --> 00:13:45.869
I take good care of my mother.

00:13:50.824 --> 00:13:53.585
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.798
She does.

00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:58.801
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.833
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

00:14:06.108 --> 00:14:07.305
Wow!

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:12.730
I like that. I like that a lot!
Come on down.

00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:14.893
Come on! For that,
you've got to come down.

00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:17.149
Come on!
Come on!

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.041
Come on!

00:14:40.926 --> 00:14:42.477
Okay, we've got
a big show tonight.

00:14:42.502 --> 00:14:44.606
Stay tuned.
We will be right back.

00:14:45.645 --> 00:14:47.380
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:50.117
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say, it made my day.

00:14:50.604 --> 00:14:51.780
Thanks, Murray.

00:14:52.152 --> 00:14:55.208
You see all this, the lights, the show,
the audience, all that stuff?

00:14:55.263 --> 00:14:57.852
I'd give it all up in a heartbeat
to have a kid like you.

00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:40.779
You're such a jerk.

00:15:40.804 --> 00:15:43.247
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

00:15:43.247 --> 00:15:45.545
Another day in chuckle town.

00:15:49.517 --> 00:15:50.895
You okay?

00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:54.563
I heard about the
beat-down you took.

00:15:55.576 --> 00:15:56.923
Fucking savages.

00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:01.137
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should've left them alone.

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:03.779
No, they'll take everything
from here if you do that.

00:16:04.023 --> 00:16:07.072
All the crazy shit out there?
They're animals.

00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:13.567
You know what?

00:16:18.574 --> 00:16:19.880
Here.

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:22.406
What is it?

00:16:23.102 --> 00:16:24.111
Take it.

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.035
It's for you.

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:32.357
You gotta protect yourself out there,

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:34.723
otherwise you're
gonna get fucked.

00:16:36.474 --> 00:16:37.702
Randall.

00:16:39.047 --> 00:16:41.462
I'm not supposed to have a gun.

00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:46.444
Don't sweat it, Art.
No one has to know.

00:16:46.737 --> 00:16:48.991
And you can pay me
back some other time.

00:16:49.302 --> 00:16:50.665
You know you're my boy.

00:16:52.526 --> 00:16:56.222
Arthur... Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

00:16:56.247 --> 00:16:58.794
Hey, Gary, you know what
I've always wondered?

00:16:58.846 --> 00:16:59.932
No idea.

00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:03.678
Do you people call it miniature golf,
or is it just golf to you?

00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:11.577
Punch him in the dick, Gary.

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:29.639
Hello, Hoyt.

00:17:30.037 --> 00:17:32.360
Gary said you wanted to see me?

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.660
How's the comedy career?
You're a famous stand-up yet?

00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:36.951
Not quite.

00:17:37.195 --> 00:17:38.937
Just been working on
my material.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.962
No, don't sit.
This will be quick.

00:17:41.214 --> 00:17:43.520
Look.
I like you, Arthur.

00:17:43.545 --> 00:17:46.235
You know, lot of the guys here
think you're a freak, but I like you.

00:17:47.048 --> 00:17:48.601
I don't even know
why I like you.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.659
But I got another complaint.

00:17:51.536 --> 00:17:54.276
And it's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

00:17:54.321 --> 00:17:56.359
The guy said you disappeared.

00:17:56.722 --> 00:17:58.375
Never even returned his sign.

00:17:58.965 --> 00:18:00.732
Because I got jumped.

00:18:01.085 --> 00:18:02.393
Didn't you hear?

00:18:02.785 --> 00:18:04.156
For a sign?

00:18:04.466 --> 00:18:06.847
It's bullshit.
It doesn't make sense,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.822
just give him his sign back.

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:11.404
He's going out of business
for God's sake, Arthur.

00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:13.452
Why would
I keep that sign?

00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:16.116
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:19.352
If you don't return the sign,

00:18:19.718 --> 00:18:21.775
I got to take it out
of your pay check.

00:18:22.772 --> 00:18:24.264
Are we clear?

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.723
Listen, I'm trying to help you. Okay?

00:18:28.748 --> 00:18:30.218
Now I tell you something else.

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:33.399
The other guys, they don't feel
comfortable around you, Arthur.

00:18:33.837 --> 00:18:35.966
Because people think
you're weird, okay?

00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:38.245
And I can't have that around me.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.272
I want it-- I want it to work out---

00:19:29.024 --> 00:19:31.984
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait!

00:19:34.178 --> 00:19:35.834
Thank you.

00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:59.665
This building is
so awful, isn't it?

00:20:01.655 --> 00:20:04.305
This building is so awful,
right, mommy?

00:20:04.445 --> 00:20:06.731
Yeah, sweetie.
I hear you, GiGi.

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:09.476
It's so awful, mommy.

00:20:10.838 --> 00:20:12.691
Right, mommy?

00:20:19.098 --> 00:20:20.967
- It's fine.
- This building's so awful, isn't it?

00:20:27.802 --> 00:20:28.811
Hey.

00:20:35.106 --> 00:20:36.115
Come on.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.871
Head up.

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:00.528
Maybe the mailman
is throwing them away.

00:21:00.723 --> 00:21:03.635
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

00:21:04.449 --> 00:21:06.833
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- He's gonna help us.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.769
You worked
for them, what?

00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:12.083
30 years ago?

00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:13.669
Why would he help us?

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.535
Because Thomas
Wayne is a good man.

00:21:17.739 --> 00:21:19.719
If he knew how we were living,

00:21:20.469 --> 00:21:23.190
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

00:21:25.047 --> 00:21:26.949
I can't explain it to
you any better than that.

00:21:29.507 --> 00:21:31.415
I don't want you
worrying about money.

00:21:32.581 --> 00:21:33.716
Or me.

00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:37.860
Everybody’s telling me that my
stand-up is ready for the big clubs.

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:41.785
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

00:21:42.227 --> 00:21:43.916
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:47.000
don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

00:22:51.741 --> 00:22:53.516
Hey, what's your name?

00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:55.300
Arthur.

00:22:56.069 --> 00:22:57.078
Hey, Arthur.

00:22:57.431 --> 00:22:59.142
You're a really good dancer.

00:23:00.035 --> 00:23:01.445
I know.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.962
And who is not?

00:23:03.128 --> 00:23:04.458
Him.

00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:11.418
Happy! What was that?
Are you okay?

00:23:11.443 --> 00:23:12.742
Mom, what?

00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:14.850
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:17.296
I'm-- I'm watching
an old war movie!

00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:19.073
Turn it down!

00:23:24.547 --> 00:23:25.946
It's hard, mom.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.848
It's nice to see these
couples are at my show.

00:24:51.895 --> 00:24:54.044
I have a wife,
we love to role play.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.697
Yes. Yes, very sexy.

00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:58.647
My favorite one right now is...

00:24:58.741 --> 00:25:02.995
professor and senior who really
needs to pass my class to graduate.

00:25:04.274 --> 00:25:05.283
Yes.

00:25:07.017 --> 00:25:08.333
So I tell you how I operate.

00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:11.040
I'm a professor at a prestigious
New England university.

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:16.390
And my wife is a senior in
my intro to western civ.

00:25:18.638 --> 00:25:21.880
I know, I know, why is she--
why is she a senior in intro?

00:25:22.024 --> 00:25:23.632
I didn't buy it either.

00:25:23.966 --> 00:25:26.598
So she comes to me
during my office hours,

00:25:26.896 --> 00:25:28.512
Monday and Wednesday
3:00 to 5:00,

00:25:28.537 --> 00:25:30.406
and she says, - excuse me,
professor Lewis.

00:25:30.986 --> 00:25:34.336
I can't use my real last name at this
collage 'cause they don't hire Jews.

00:25:36.393 --> 00:25:39.479
Something I'll address once
I have a tenure, but for now.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.454
She says, - excuse me professor Lewis.

00:25:42.479 --> 00:25:45.073
I think I might be in danger
of failing intro to western civ.

00:25:45.098 --> 00:25:47.729
and I just want you to know I'm
willing to do anything to pass.

00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:52.078
I said "anything?",
and she says "Aah".

00:26:58.965 --> 00:27:00.274
Oh. Hey.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.428
Hey.

00:27:01.905 --> 00:27:03.633
Were you following me today?

00:27:06.972 --> 00:27:08.282
Yeah.

00:27:10.585 --> 00:27:11.988
I thought that was you.

00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:15.504
I was hoping you'd come
in and rob the place.

00:27:17.596 --> 00:27:18.883
I have a gun.

00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:20.470
I'll come by tomorrow.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.412
You're so funny, Arthur.

00:27:28.012 --> 00:27:29.332
Yeah...

00:27:29.475 --> 00:27:31.812
You know, I--I do
stand-up comedy.

00:27:31.945 --> 00:27:34.540
You should maybe come
and see a show sometime.

00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:36.285
I could do that.

00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:37.858
Yeah?

00:27:38.162 --> 00:27:39.857
Yeah.
You let me know when?

00:27:39.878 --> 00:27:40.887
Yeah.

I love this job.

00:28:42.376 --> 00:28:46.888
Arthur, I need to know why you
brought a gun into a kids hospital.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.718
It's a part.
It's part of my act now.

00:28:49.965 --> 00:28:51.704
That's bullshit!
Bullshit!

00:28:51.983 --> 00:28:54.173
What kind of a clown
carries a fucking gun?

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.864
Besides, Randall told me you tried
to buy a .38 off him last week.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.649
- Randall told you that?
- You 're fuck up, Arthur.

00:29:02.197 --> 00:29:03.536
And a liar.

00:29:03.685 --> 00:29:05.102
You're fired!

00:29:37.127 --> 00:29:39.974
I'm telling you, she wanted my number.
We should have just stayed.

00:29:39.999 --> 00:29:42.797
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested... at all.

00:29:42.888 --> 00:29:45.344
Are you nuts? Did you see
how close we were dancing!?

00:29:45.369 --> 00:29:46.211
She was in love, bro.

00:29:46.236 --> 00:29:48.015
She couldn't wait
to get away from you.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.813

You sure?

00:30:08.767 --> 00:30:10.316
They're really good.

00:30:12.827 --> 00:30:15.711
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

Nothing. I---

00:31:55.672 --> 00:31:57.617
I have a---
I have a condition.

00:31:57.712 --> 00:32:00.000
I'll tell you what you have,
asshole.

00:32:06.975 --> 00:32:10.119
We've got a kicker, huh? Hey,
hold him steady, hold him steady.

00:32:12.511 --> 00:32:14.349
Stay down, freak!

00:32:29.045 --> 00:32:31.876
No! No!

00:32:33.137 --> 00:32:34.708
Hey! Help! Help!

00:32:58.564 --> 00:33:00.423
Hey!

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.968
Stay clear of the closing doors.

00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:43.799
I read it was a guy
in a full make-up.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.546
No, it says right here
it was a mask.

00:36:46.553 --> 00:36:48.742
Either way, I think
it's good for business.

00:36:48.899 --> 00:36:50.837
They got clowns in front
of every newspaper.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.771
- Big man, what's the good word?
- Hey.

00:36:56.836 --> 00:36:59.228
Hey, Arthur.
I heard what happened.

00:36:59.338 --> 00:37:00.479
Sorry, mate.

00:37:00.933 --> 00:37:03.532
Yeah, it doesn't seem fair,

00:37:03.802 --> 00:37:05.648
you get fired like that.

00:37:06.501 --> 00:37:09.151
Did you really bring a gun to
the children's hospital, Arty?

00:37:10.341 --> 00:37:11.758
What the fuck would
you do that for?

00:37:12.046 --> 00:37:13.430
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

00:37:13.455 --> 00:37:15.978
If your dancing doesn't do the trick,
you just gonna shoot yourself?

00:37:17.686 --> 00:37:19.610
Why don't you ask
Randall about it?

00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:21.352
It was his gun.

00:37:21.634 --> 00:37:24.425
- What?
- I still owe you for that, don't I?

00:37:24.614 --> 00:37:26.439
What the fuck are
you talking about?

00:37:26.635 --> 00:37:29.130
Stop talking outta
your ass, Art!

00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:35.454
Oh, no!

00:37:36.662 --> 00:37:38.251
I forgot to punch out.

00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:12.149
And as our city tries
to make sense of the brutal

00:38:12.149 --> 00:38:14.296
triple murder on the subway last week.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.157
We're joined by Thomas Wayne.

00:38:16.421 --> 00:38:18.681
- Happy, look. Thomas Wayne's on TV.
- He has a personnel connection

00:38:18.736 --> 00:38:20.162
- Yes, mother.
- this tragedy.

00:38:20.162 --> 00:38:21.216
Thanks for having me on show.

00:38:21.517 --> 00:38:24.066
They're asking him about
those horrible subway murders.

00:38:24.361 --> 00:38:27.614
Thank you, Thomas. I know
this is a difficult time for you.

00:38:27.662 --> 00:38:29.000
- Why him?
- These young men all were...

00:38:29.413 --> 00:38:31.313
Looks like his compaign.

00:38:31.564 --> 00:38:33.758
Yes, all three of them
worked for Wayne investments.

00:38:34.034 --> 00:38:35.669
Good, decent, educated,

00:38:35.818 --> 00:38:38.781
although, I didn't know
any of them personally.

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:43.973
Like all the Wayne employees,
past and present, they were family.

00:38:44.161 --> 00:38:45.725
You hear that! I told you.
We're family.

00:38:45.751 --> 00:38:49.985
There now seems to be a a groundswell
of anti-rich sentiment in the city.

00:38:49.888 --> 00:38:54.277
It's almost as if our less fortunate
residents are taken the side of the killer.

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:55.646
Yes and it's a shame.

00:38:56.022 --> 00:38:58.727
It's one of the reasons why
I'm considering a run for mayor.

00:38:59.526 --> 00:39:01.089
Gotham has lost its way.

00:39:01.973 --> 00:39:05.891
What about the eyewitness report of
the suspect being a man in a clown mask?

00:39:06.696 --> 00:39:08.352
Well, it makes total sense to me.

00:39:08.985 --> 00:39:11.433
What kind of a coward would do
something that cold-blooded ?

00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:13.287
Someone who hides
behind a mask.

00:39:13.646 --> 00:39:18.229
Someone who is envious of those
more fortunate than themselves,

00:39:19.254 --> 00:39:21.803
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

00:39:22.202 --> 00:39:24.680
And until all those kind of
people change for the better..

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.043
those of us who've made
something of our lives,

00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:30.670
will always look at
those who haven't

00:39:31.374 --> 00:39:33.115
as nothing but clowns.

00:39:35.355 --> 00:39:37.937
Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.

00:39:37.962 --> 00:39:39.356
It's not funny.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:03.326
I heard this song on the
radio the other day.

00:40:05.893 --> 00:40:07.513
And the guy was singing,

00:40:08.052 --> 00:40:10.171
that his name was Carnival.

00:40:11.094 --> 00:40:13.549
- Arthur.
- It's just crazy,

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:18.493
because that's my
clown name. At work.

00:40:20.048 --> 00:40:22.060
But until a while ago

00:40:23.818 --> 00:40:25.993
it was like nobody
ever saw me.

00:40:28.273 --> 00:40:30.449
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

00:40:31.049 --> 00:40:32.988
Arthur, I have some
bad news for you.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.343
You don't listen, do you?

00:40:39.886 --> 00:40:41.577
I don't think you ever

00:40:42.381 --> 00:40:43.970
really hear me.

00:40:45.208 --> 00:40:47.713
You just ask the same
questions every week:

00:40:48.094 --> 00:40:49.272
"How was your job?"

00:40:49.272 --> 00:40:51.135
"Are you having any
negative thoughts?"

00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:55.370
All I have are negative thoughts.

00:40:56.152 --> 00:40:58.404
But you don't listen. Anyway,

00:40:59.202 --> 00:41:00.210
I said,

00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:02.269
for my whole life

00:41:02.768 --> 00:41:05.758
I didn't know if I
even really existed.

00:41:07.504 --> 00:41:08.843
But I do.

00:41:10.507 --> 00:41:13.762
And people are
starting to notice.

00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:17.749
They've cut our funding.

00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:19.694
We're closing down
our offices next week.

00:41:21.225 --> 00:41:24.816
The city's cut funding across the board,
social services is part of that.

00:41:25.174 --> 00:41:27.199
This is the last time
we will be meeting.

00:41:28.318 --> 00:41:29.327
Okay.

00:41:33.643 --> 00:41:35.902
They don't give a shit about
people like you, Arthur.

00:41:37.944 --> 00:41:40.900
And they really don't give a shit
about people like me, either.

00:41:44.765 --> 00:41:45.774
Oh, fuck.

00:41:54.215 --> 00:41:56.506
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

00:41:59.822 --> 00:42:01.353
Who do I talk to?

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.908
I'm sorry, Arthur.

00:42:08.235 --> 00:42:11.924
I think, uh-- I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

00:42:12.631 --> 00:42:15.310
You know, like, "can I see
myself in this long term?"

00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:18.441
Is it safe. Is it reliable?

00:42:19.043 --> 00:42:21.211
Could it kill me?

00:42:21.236 --> 00:42:24.834
Most guys look at sex like parking a car.
We're like "there's a spot".

00:42:25.977 --> 00:42:28.489
"There is another spot,
that would work."

00:42:28.514 --> 00:42:31.154
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.557
"Handicapped?
Hope no one sees us."

00:42:38.254 --> 00:42:40.841
Alright that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.833
One more time, ya' all.

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:53.161
Alright, this next comic describes
himself as a lifelong Gotham resident

00:42:53.186 --> 00:42:55.788
who from a young age
was always told that:

00:42:55.813 --> 00:43:00.357
"his purpose in life was to bring laughter
and joy into this cold, dark world."

00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:02.383
Umm.. okay.

00:43:02.839 --> 00:43:06.204
Please help me welcome
Arthur Fleck, ya' all. Arthur Fleck.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.944
Hello, it's good to be here---

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.121
I hate--

00:43:57.242 --> 00:43:59.305
I---I hated

00:43:59.414 --> 00:44:01.351
school as a kid.

00:44:16.506 --> 00:44:20.036
I hated school as a--
as a kid.

00:44:22.469 --> 00:44:24.156
But my mother
would always say, -

00:44:24.181 --> 00:44:28.405
"you should enjoy it.
One day you'll have to work for a living."

00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:32.824
"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"

00:44:45.018 --> 00:44:46.440
Here is one.

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:51.005
You know, I was just
thinking the other day,

00:44:51.279 --> 00:44:53.723
why are the rich people so---

00:45:33.288 --> 00:45:35.106
Do you believe that shit?

00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:37.591
Fuck 'em!

00:45:39.295 --> 00:45:42.134
I think the guy that
did it is a hero.

00:45:44.228 --> 00:45:48.686
Three less pricks in Gotham city,
only a million more to go.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.799
I know what you're gonna be thinking.

00:46:19.999 --> 00:46:22.879
And buddy, as always
thanks for the laughs.

00:46:22.879 --> 00:46:25.632
Sure, will see you again.
You will be here, right? I hope.

00:46:27.245 --> 00:46:29.858
Tomorrow night,
we have Diana Hudson,

00:46:30.006 --> 00:46:33.848
Grieg Gordon, and animal
expert Hugh Little.

00:46:34.597 --> 00:46:36.021
Thanks for watching.

00:46:36.098 --> 00:46:38.161
Good night. And always remember

00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:39.914
"That's Life".

00:46:44.187 --> 00:46:45.661
That's life.

00:46:50.408 --> 00:46:53.498
Mom, time to wake up.
We go to bed.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.738
No, Happy.

00:47:01.404 --> 00:47:03.194
I wrote him a new letter.

00:47:03.234 --> 00:47:05.210
Come on, dance with me.

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:08.466
For Thomas Wayne.
That's important.

00:47:17.045 --> 00:47:19.080
You smell like cologne.

00:47:19.347 --> 00:47:21.584
Because I just had a big date.

00:47:26.273 --> 00:47:28.718
Just don't forget to mail it.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.351
You're gonna kill me!
You're gonna give me a hard time!

00:49:04.376 --> 00:49:07.165
- I won't give you a---
- No! No!

00:49:07.795 --> 00:49:10.728
I'm not talking to you until
you stop being angry!

00:49:10.808 --> 00:49:12.113
Okay.

00:49:12.373 --> 00:49:13.382
Okay.

00:49:17.862 --> 00:49:19.457
I'm not angry, mom.

00:49:20.272 --> 00:49:21.783
I'm not angry.

00:49:22.696 --> 00:49:23.705
Please.

00:49:25.002 --> 00:49:28.108
Mom, is this real?

00:49:31.377 --> 00:49:34.052
He is an extraordinary man, Happy.

00:49:34.856 --> 00:49:36.816
He is a very powerful man.

00:49:38.834 --> 00:49:40.016
We were in love.

00:49:41.827 --> 00:49:45.458
He said it was best if we would not be
together because of appearances.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.872
And I couldn’t tell
anyone because,

00:49:52.845 --> 00:49:53.853
well,

00:49:54.416 --> 00:49:56.238
I signed some papers.

00:49:57.148 --> 00:50:00.854
And besides, you can imagine
what people would say about

00:50:01.183 --> 00:50:02.893
Thomas and me and...

00:50:04.842 --> 00:50:06.673
what they’d say about you.

00:50:10.457 --> 00:50:12.593
What would they say, mom?

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:47.053
Hi.

00:52:50.004 --> 00:52:51.754
What's your name?

00:52:52.607 --> 00:52:54.267
I'm Bruce.

00:52:55.161 --> 00:52:56.556
Bruce.

00:52:58.131 --> 00:52:59.579
I'm Arthur.

00:53:21.586 --> 00:53:23.232
That's better.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.811
Bruce! Bruce!

00:53:27.534 --> 00:53:30.336
- Get away from that man.
- It's okay. I'm a good guy.

00:53:30.487 --> 00:53:32.120
What are you doing?
Who are you?

00:53:32.331 --> 00:53:33.867
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

00:53:34.224 --> 00:53:36.600
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

00:53:38.116 --> 00:53:40.987
- Where did you get him these flowers?
- No, they're not real.

00:53:42.435 --> 00:53:44.106
It's...magic.

00:53:44.873 --> 00:53:48.102
- I was just trying to make him smile.
- Well, It's not funny, is it?

00:53:49.262 --> 00:53:50.676
Do I need to call the police?

00:53:50.716 --> 00:53:52.188
No, please.

00:53:53.336 --> 00:53:55.098
My mother's name is Penny.

00:53:55.284 --> 00:53:56.641
Penny Fleck.

00:53:57.014 --> 00:53:58.360
She used to work here years ago.

00:53:58.385 --> 00:54:00.307
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

00:54:01.691 --> 00:54:03.195
You're her son?

00:54:03.286 --> 00:54:04.896
Yeah.

00:54:04.936 --> 00:54:06.445
Did you know her?

00:54:10.168 --> 00:54:12.076
I know about the two of them.

00:54:13.084 --> 00:54:14.755
She told me everything.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.110
There's nothing to know.

00:54:20.365 --> 00:54:22.166
There is no "them".

00:54:22.994 --> 00:54:24.593
Your mother was delusional.

00:54:26.006 --> 00:54:28.062
- She was a sick woman.
- Don't

00:54:28.071 --> 00:54:29.238
say that.

00:54:30.597 --> 00:54:32.407
Just go.

00:54:33.185 --> 00:54:35.414
Before you make
a fool of yourself.

00:54:37.244 --> 00:54:40.236
- Thomas Wayne is my farther.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.337
He left me!

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:50.200
Let go!

00:55:16.185 --> 00:55:18.419
Keep your respiration’s around 15.

00:55:18.444 --> 00:55:20.819
Slow, there're some stairs
coming up.

00:55:20.844 --> 00:55:22.667
Mom?

00:55:24.064 --> 00:55:25.357
- What happened?
- Who are you?

00:55:25.357 --> 00:55:27.098
- I'm her son.
- Oh, great.

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.944
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out to decide.

00:55:28.969 --> 00:55:31.355
- We don't know what happened yet.
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.532
Come on. We have
one more left.

00:55:33.699 --> 00:55:35.976
I'm getting a little resistence
here. Come on, give her a lift.

00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:38.131
Position her head.

00:55:38.214 --> 00:55:39.826
Lift.

00:55:46.565 --> 00:55:47.313
Excuse me, sir.

00:55:47.807 --> 00:55:49.996
- Does your mother take any medications?
- No.

00:55:50.021 --> 00:55:51.389
- Excuse me, I can't hear you.
- No.

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:53.868
- Sir, what was the last time
you spoke to her? - I don't know.

00:56:39.103 --> 00:56:40.112
Mr. Fleck.

00:56:41.407 --> 00:56:43.389
Sorry to bother you.
I'm detective Garrity.

00:56:43.414 --> 00:56:45.457
This is my partner
detective Burke.

00:56:46.044 --> 00:56:48.679
We had a few questions for you,
but you weren’t home.

00:56:48.874 --> 00:56:51.762
So... we spoke with
your mother.

00:56:53.528 --> 00:56:54.537
Oh.

00:56:55.858 --> 00:56:57.270
What did you say to her?

00:56:57.297 --> 00:56:58.970
- Did you do this?
- What?

00:56:58.995 --> 00:56:59.528
No.

00:56:59.528 --> 00:57:01.767
No, no. No, we just
asked her some questions.

00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:03.654
And she got hysterical..

00:57:03.905 --> 00:57:05.376
hyperventilating,

00:57:05.899 --> 00:57:07.060
then collapsed and hit her
head pretty hard.

00:57:07.084 --> 00:57:09.415
Yeah, the doctor said
she had a stroke.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:11.282
We're sorry to hear about that.

00:57:12.355 --> 00:57:15.026
But like I said, I still has
some questions for you.

00:57:15.373 --> 00:57:17.889
They're about the subway killings
that happened last week.

00:57:17.914 --> 00:57:20.128
- You've heard about them, right?
- Yeah.

00:57:20.714 --> 00:57:22.757
- It's horrible.
- Right.

00:57:23.953 --> 00:57:27.112
So with spoke with your
boss over at...Ha-Ha's.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:30.906
He said you were fired for bringing
a gun into the children's hospital.

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:34.005
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

00:57:34.425 --> 00:57:35.844
It was part of my act.

00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:37.886
I'm a party clown.

00:57:37.952 --> 00:57:40.056
Alright, so why were you fired?

00:57:43.208 --> 00:57:45.475
They said I wasn't funny enough.

00:57:45.536 --> 00:57:47.025
Can you imagine that?

00:57:47.608 --> 00:57:48.906
If you don't mind,

00:57:50.162 --> 00:57:52.000
I have to go and take
care of my mother.

00:57:52.509 --> 00:57:55.371
Your boss also gave us
one of your cards.

00:57:57.059 --> 00:57:59.462
This condition of yours, laughing.

00:58:00.297 --> 00:58:03.057
Is it real, or some
sort of a clown thing?

00:58:03.929 --> 00:58:06.431
- "A clown thing?"
- Yeah.

00:58:06.776 --> 00:58:09.098
I mean, part of your act?

00:58:11.442 --> 00:58:12.651
What do you think?

00:58:18.814 --> 00:58:20.605
It's exit only.

00:58:43.942 --> 00:58:46.128
She's gonna be okay.

00:58:50.033 --> 00:58:52.556
I'll get a coffee.

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:54.622
- You want one?
- Yeah.

00:59:08.676 --> 00:59:11.609
So, the other night I told
my youngest son, Billy,

00:59:11.634 --> 00:59:14.237
you know, the new one, the--
not so bright one,

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:18.033
I-- I told him the garbage
strike is still going on, Billy,..

00:59:18.058 --> 00:59:20.044
and he says, and
I'm not kidding, Billy says,

00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:22.304
"So where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?".

00:59:29.504 --> 00:59:30.513
And finally,

00:59:30.851 --> 00:59:33.360
in a world where everyone
thinks they could do my job,

00:59:33.407 --> 00:59:36.841
we got this video tape from Pogo's
comedy club right here in Gotham.

00:59:36.982 --> 00:59:40.969
Here's a guy who thinks if you just keep
laughing, it'll somehow make you funny.

00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:42.752
Check out this joker.

00:59:47.741 --> 00:59:48.531
Oh, no!

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:52.192
I hated school as a kid.

00:59:53.106 --> 00:59:55.373
But my mother would always say,

00:59:56.272 --> 01:00:00.128
"You know, you should enjoy it.
One day you'll have to work for a living."

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:04.718
"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"

01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:14.121
You should have
listened to your mother.

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.559
And one more.
One more, Bobby.

01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:19.317
Uh...let's see one more.
I love this guy.

01:00:20.823 --> 01:00:21.986
It's funny.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.000
When I was a little boy

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:27.133
and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,

01:00:27.521 --> 01:00:29.273
everyone laughed at me.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.668
Well, no one's laughing now.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.658
You can say that again, pal.

01:00:43.739 --> 01:00:44.689
Alright,

01:00:44.714 --> 01:00:46.722
- We've got a great show for you tonight.
- Sure.

01:00:46.747 --> 01:00:49.889
--here actress Joan Mulligan,

01:00:49.967 --> 01:00:53.830
and new music from
Melruban and the stiff.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.054
As tensions mount
around the metro area

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:05.659
mayor Stokes has pleaded for
cooler heads to prevail.

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:07.852
City services has
been affected

01:01:07.877 --> 01:01:12.559
and some businesses have decided
to remain closed amid the unrest.

01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:15.351
Chuck Stevens filed this report.

01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:18.260
The anger and resentment that's
been building in the city for weeks

01:01:18.285 --> 01:01:20.093
seem close to exploding.

01:01:20.118 --> 01:01:23.375
Protesters, many dressed as
clowns, took the streets today

01:01:23.463 --> 01:01:26.918
in one of the several demonstrations
taking on the city's elite,

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.864
including a massive rally
outside the Wayne home.

01:01:32.497 --> 01:01:33.921
What's the point of all this?

01:01:34.014 --> 01:01:35.982
Fuck the rich!
Fuck Mr. Wayne.

01:01:36.007 --> 01:01:37.525
That's what this all fucking thing was
about.

01:01:37.713 --> 01:01:39.707
Fuck all this system!

01:01:39.809 --> 01:01:43.739
Wayne, who recently announced his running
for mayor will be attending the benefit.

01:01:44.022 --> 01:01:47.079
You might remember, it was
Thomas Wayne who first referred to

01:01:47.105 --> 01:01:50.130
many of Gotam's
residents as "clowns".

01:01:50.411 --> 01:01:53.180
Today, he offered little
in way of an apology.

01:01:53.766 --> 01:01:56.459
Well, what I will say is, there's
something wrong with those people.

01:01:56.484 --> 01:01:58.898
And I'm here to help them.
I'm gonna lift them out of poverty,

01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:01.424
help make they're lives better.
That's why I'm running.

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:04.490
They may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.

01:02:20.095 --> 01:02:22.455
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.919
- Down with Wayne!
- Down with Wayne!

01:02:58.749 --> 01:03:00.366
- Down with Wayne!
- Down with Wayne!

01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:08.530
Can I help you, pal?

01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:11.890
I don't know what to say.

01:05:15.439 --> 01:05:16.967
Do you want an autograph
or something?

01:05:17.839 --> 01:05:19.388
No.

01:05:24.892 --> 01:05:26.560
My name is Arthur.

01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:29.820
Penny Fleck is my mother.

01:05:31.031 --> 01:05:32.241
Jesus.

01:05:33.082 --> 01:05:34.762
You're the guy that came
to my house yesterday?

01:05:36.229 --> 01:05:37.629
Yes.

01:05:38.036 --> 01:05:39.853
I'm sorry I just showed up.

01:05:40.022 --> 01:05:41.780
Well, my mother
told me everything.

01:05:41.907 --> 01:05:43.495
And I had to talk to you,

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.382
- you know?
- Look, pal, I'm not your father.

01:05:45.496 --> 01:05:47.402
I mean, what's
wrong with you?

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.630
Look at us.

01:05:52.353 --> 01:05:55.601
- I think you are.
- Well, that's impossible.

01:05:55.981 --> 01:05:58.340
Because you were adopted and
I never slept with your mother.

01:05:58.365 --> 01:06:00.018
What do you want
from me, money?

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.128
No. I don't want.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.889
- I wasn't adopted.
- Jesus. She never told you?

01:06:04.741 --> 01:06:06.365
Told me what?

01:06:07.391 --> 01:06:09.409
Your mother adopted you while
she was working for us.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:11.755
That's not true.
Why are you saying that?

01:06:11.755 --> 01:06:14.349
Because she was arrested and
committed to Arkham State Hospital

01:06:14.373 --> 01:06:15.823
..when you were just a little boy.

01:06:15.882 --> 01:06:17.241
Why are you saying this?

01:06:17.399 --> 01:06:20.648
I don't need you to tell me lies.
I know it seems strange.

01:06:20.683 --> 01:06:22.226
I don't mean to make
you uncomfortable.

01:06:22.251 --> 01:06:24.187
I don't why everyone is so rude,

01:06:24.211 --> 01:06:26.920
and I don't why you are,
I don't want anything from you.

01:06:26.945 --> 01:06:29.446
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug dad!

01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:31.344
How much as a little bit
of fucking decency?

01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:32.832
What is it with you people?!

01:06:33.001 --> 01:06:35.038
Did you see the way
suffer my mother?

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.330
- She's crazy.
- She's-- huh-huh!

01:06:46.242 --> 01:06:48.445
- You think this is funny?
- Yeah---huh-huh!

01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:50.867
Dad, it's me!

01:06:51.063 --> 01:06:52.118
Come on---huh--huh!

01:06:54.795 --> 01:06:57.260
You touch my son again,
I'll fucking kill you!

01:07:18.261 --> 01:07:21.060
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is detective Garrity.

01:07:21.085 --> 01:07:23.382
We met the other night
at the Gotham General.

01:07:23.547 --> 01:07:25.978
My partner and I had
a few more questions for you.

01:07:26.003 --> 01:07:29.032
We stopped by your apartment today,
but you weren't at home.

01:07:29.057 --> 01:07:31.286
Please, give me a call when
you've heard this message.

01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:33.193
Again, this is detective Garrity.

01:07:33.218 --> 01:07:37.244
My number is 212---99.

01:08:19.524 --> 01:08:21.717
Uh, this message is
for Arthur Fleck.

01:08:21.742 --> 01:08:25.581
My name is Shirley Woods,
I work on the Murray Franklin show.

01:08:25.706 --> 01:08:26.980
I don't know
if you're aware,

01:08:27.005 --> 01:08:29.921
but Murray played a clip of your
stand-up on the show recently

01:08:29.946 --> 01:08:32.994
and we've gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

01:08:33.104 --> 01:08:35.576
And Mr. Murray asked me to
give you a call and see if you're---

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:40.832
Who is this?

01:08:41.382 --> 01:08:43.290
Oh. Hi, this is Shirley Woods.

01:08:43.315 --> 01:08:46.034
I'm the show-booker from
Live With Murray Franklin.

01:08:46.059 --> 01:08:47.773
Is this Arthur?

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.169
Yes.

01:08:50.287 --> 01:08:52.212
Hi, Arthur.
Well, and as I was saying,

01:08:52.237 --> 01:08:55.944
we've gotten a lot of calls about
your clip, amazing responses.

01:08:56.364 --> 01:08:58.447
And, Murray asked if I
would reach out to you

01:08:58.472 --> 01:09:00.373
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:08.343
Murray wants me to come
on the Murray Franklin show?

01:09:08.924 --> 01:09:10.468
Yeah. Isn't that great?

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:13.135
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act.

01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:16.013
Does that sound good to you?

01:09:20.822 --> 01:09:22.325
Yeah, that's sounds great.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.991
Can we set up
a date right now?

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.799
Are you available next Thursday?

01:10:20.268 --> 01:10:21.276
Hey.

01:10:21.909 --> 01:10:23.263
Wooh. Man.

01:10:23.297 --> 01:10:24.785
Sorry about that, my man.

01:10:25.017 --> 01:10:27.428
All our records that are 10 years
or older are stored in the basement

01:10:27.453 --> 01:10:30.546
and you're talking about
something' 30 years ago, so.

01:10:31.674 --> 01:10:33.763
Can I ask you a question?

01:10:33.924 --> 01:10:34.933
Sure.

01:10:35.668 --> 01:10:39.047
How does someone
wind up in here?

01:10:40.549 --> 01:10:41.717
Have they all---

01:10:42.043 --> 01:10:44.023
all the people committed crimes?

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.303
Oh, yeah. Some have.

01:10:47.683 --> 01:10:51.468
Some are just crazy and pose a
danger to themselves or others.

01:10:52.056 --> 01:10:53.622
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

01:10:54.105 --> 01:10:55.718
Don't know what to do, you know?

01:10:55.887 --> 01:10:58.881
- Yeah, I hear you, brother.

01:10:59.865 --> 01:11:02.188
Sometimes, I don't
know what to do.

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:07.008
Last time I ended up taking
it out on some people.

01:11:08.275 --> 01:11:11.418
I thought it was gonna bother me
but, it really hasn't.

01:11:13.334 --> 01:11:14.343
What's that?

01:11:15.373 --> 01:11:16.749
I fucked up.

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:19.990
I've done some bad shit.

01:11:20.699 --> 01:11:21.708
Um...

01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:23.980
You know what
I'm talking about.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.331
It’s so hard just to try and be

01:11:27.557 --> 01:11:29.809
happy all the time.

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:33.398
Hey, um, listen, man...

01:11:33.973 --> 01:11:35.664
I'm just an
administrative assistant.

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:38.438
Like a clerk, you know.
All I do is file paperwork,

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:41.281
I don't know what to tell you,

01:11:41.707 --> 01:11:43.037
but you should see somebody.

01:11:44.404 --> 01:11:45.843
They have programs,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.436
city services, stuff like that.

01:11:48.518 --> 01:11:49.727
Oh, yeah.

01:11:49.934 --> 01:11:51.623
They cut all those.

01:11:56.509 --> 01:11:58.090
All right.
Here it is.

01:11:58.175 --> 01:12:01.140
Fleck. Penny Fleck. I see.

01:12:01.315 --> 01:12:05.115
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner...

01:12:06.439 --> 01:12:08.049
Oh, the patient suffers from

01:12:08.833 --> 01:12:10.598
delusional psychosis

01:12:10.654 --> 01:12:14.025
and narcissistic
personality disorder...hm.

01:12:14.637 --> 01:12:16.898
Was found guilty of
endangering the welfare

01:12:16.923 --> 01:12:19.845
of her own child--

01:12:27.897 --> 01:12:28.967
What?

01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:33.849
You said she's your mother?

01:12:40.032 --> 01:12:43.630
I'm sorry,man. Like I said, I can't
release these records, you know,

01:12:43.655 --> 01:12:47.142
without the proper forms.
I--I could get in trouble.

01:12:48.332 --> 01:12:51.285
Look, if you wanna bring your mom in
here to sign, that would be much easier,

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:53.898
but, I can't-- I can't let this go
without a signature, okay?

01:12:54.555 --> 01:12:56.041
I'm sorry.

01:12:59.681 --> 01:13:00.808
No, man!

01:13:02.429 --> 01:13:04.610
Come on, man! Give it to me!

01:13:05.376 --> 01:13:07.267
Hey! Hey!

01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:08.966
We went over this, Penny.

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:10.526
You adopted him.

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.526
We have all the
paperwork right here.

01:14:12.986 --> 01:14:14.399
That's not true.

01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:17.913
Thomas had them
all made up,

01:14:18.117 --> 01:14:20.161
so it stayed our secret.

01:14:22.338 --> 01:14:24.207
You also stood by

01:14:25.355 --> 01:14:27.936
as one of your boyfriends
repeatedly abused

01:14:28.724 --> 01:14:30.462
your adopted son

01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:33.151
and battered you.

01:14:52.097 --> 01:14:53.480
Penny,

01:14:54.373 --> 01:14:57.375
your son was found
tied to a radiator

01:14:58.307 --> 01:14:59.933
in your filthy apartment,

01:15:00.675 --> 01:15:03.300
malnourished, with multiple
bruises across his body

01:15:03.325 --> 01:15:05.419
and severe trauma to his head.

01:15:07.038 --> 01:15:09.111
I never heard him crying.

01:15:10.063 --> 01:15:13.079
He's always been such
a happy little boy.

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:16.370
Shh...it's time for bed.

01:17:19.773 --> 01:17:21.163
Oh, my god!

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.141
What are you doing in here?

01:17:25.773 --> 01:17:27.435
You're in the wrong apartment.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.664
Your name is Arthur, right?

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:37.882
You live down the hall.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.633
I really need you to leave.

01:17:46.785 --> 01:17:49.072
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

01:17:54.174 --> 01:17:56.041
Please.

01:17:58.602 --> 01:18:00.434
I've had a bad day.

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:05.507
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

01:19:54.174 --> 01:19:55.506
Hi, Penny.

01:19:57.838 --> 01:19:59.550
Penny Fleck.

01:20:07.253 --> 01:20:09.068
I always hated that name.

01:20:12.504 --> 01:20:14.109
You know, you used to tell me

01:20:16.524 --> 01:20:17.892
that my laugh

01:20:18.002 --> 01:20:19.399
was a condition,

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:22.709
that there are
something wrong with me.

01:20:25.732 --> 01:20:27.186
There isn't.

01:20:29.613 --> 01:20:30.973
That’s the real me.

01:20:31.739 --> 01:20:33.637
Ha--appy

01:20:35.424 --> 01:20:36.433
"Happy".

01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:38.498
Funny.

01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:42.736
I haven't been happy

01:20:43.649 --> 01:20:46.199
for one minute of my
entire fucking life.

01:20:52.939 --> 01:20:54.709
You know what's funny?

01:20:57.178 --> 01:20:59.067
You know what really
makes me laugh?

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.896
I used to think that
my life was a tragedy,

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:07.159
but now I realize

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:08.809
that's a fucking comedy.

01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:22.342
A very fine actor.

01:22:22.367 --> 01:22:24.976
He's got a new movie
called 'American Playboy',

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:28.525
opening this week across the country.
Will you please welcome

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:31.250
a good friend of the
show, Mr. Ethan Chase.

01:22:50.885 --> 01:22:52.934
Good to see you, Ethan.
You looking great.

01:22:52.959 --> 01:22:54.483
Thank you very much.
You look good yourself.

01:22:54.508 --> 01:22:55.517
Ah, can't complain.

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:58.330
Hi, Murray,
Thank so much for having---

01:22:59.762 --> 01:23:00.770
Hey, Murray.

01:23:00.981 --> 01:23:02.928
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:05.370
It's been a lifetime
dream of mine.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.062
I'm nervous right now.

01:23:10.824 --> 01:23:12.234
- What?
- I am.

01:23:12.828 --> 01:23:14.472
Hey, Murray.
I've been a ---

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:15.909
That's---

01:23:28.441 --> 01:23:30.102
I'm sorry, what's that?

01:23:30.925 --> 01:23:32.898
Oh, that's really funny, Murray.

01:23:34.108 --> 01:23:36.095
You know, I'm also a comedian.

01:23:36.368 --> 01:23:37.958
Would you like to hear a joke?

01:23:38.777 --> 01:23:40.807
Yeah?
All of you?

01:23:41.944 --> 01:23:43.327
Okay.

01:23:45.634 --> 01:23:47.924
Knock.
Knock- knock.

01:24:01.477 --> 01:24:02.883

Hey, Arthur.

01:26:14.303 --> 01:26:15.554
How's it going?

01:26:16.127 --> 01:26:17.343
Oh, hi, guys.

01:26:18.012 --> 01:26:19.268
Come on in.

01:26:19.987 --> 01:26:21.562
Did you, uh,
get a new gig?

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.649
No.

01:26:23.296 --> 01:26:25.940
Oh, you must be going down
to that rally at City Hall.

01:26:26.302 --> 01:26:28.155
I hear It's gonna be nuts.

01:26:28.256 --> 01:26:29.733
Is it today?

01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:31.642
Yeah.

01:26:32.515 --> 01:26:34.050
What's with the make-up, then?

01:26:35.325 --> 01:26:36.876
My mom died.

01:26:36.903 --> 01:26:38.203
I'm celebrating.

01:26:38.831 --> 01:26:42.146
Right. Uh.. we heard. That's--
That's why we came by. Figured...

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.419
uh, you could use
some cheering up.

01:26:44.419 --> 01:26:45.767
Oh, that's sweet.

01:26:46.085 --> 01:26:47.768
But, no.

01:26:47.937 --> 01:26:49.297
I feel good.

01:26:49.654 --> 01:26:51.306
I stopped taking
my medication.

01:26:51.664 --> 01:26:53.183
I feel lot better now.

01:26:55.145 --> 01:26:56.510
Oh, okay.

01:26:56.677 --> 01:26:57.867
Well, good for you.

01:27:00.907 --> 01:27:03.939
So, hey, listen. Uh, I don't
know if you're heard, but..

01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:06.678
the cops had been calling
around the shop

01:27:06.905 --> 01:27:08.983
talking all the guys about

01:27:09.347 --> 01:27:11.668
those subway murders.

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.285
They didn't talk to me.

01:27:14.367 --> 01:27:16.984
That's because the suspect
was a regular sized person.

01:27:17.504 --> 01:27:19.658
If it was a fucking midget
you'd be in jail right now.

01:27:25.554 --> 01:27:27.151
Anyway, um...

01:27:27.439 --> 01:27:29.133
Hoyt said that, um...

01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:31.000
they talked to you and

01:27:31.184 --> 01:27:32.541
now they're looking for me---

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.123
I just want to know
what you said.

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.878
Make sure our stories line up,

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:37.496
- seeing as, um--
- Yeah.

01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:39.031
- you're my boy and, uh
- Yeah,

01:27:39.056 --> 01:27:40.585
- it makes lot of sense,
- you know what I mean?

01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:42.225
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:43.898
- I just wanna--
- Oh ,fuck!

01:27:49.107 --> 01:27:50.308
Oh, god!

01:27:50.881 --> 01:27:51.926
No!

01:27:53.455 --> 01:27:54.836
What?

01:27:55.909 --> 01:27:57.182
No!

01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:06.601
Why would you do that?

01:28:27.034 --> 01:28:28.808
Do you watch Murray
Franklin show?

01:28:29.317 --> 01:28:30.326
Yeah.

01:28:31.977 --> 01:28:33.251
I'll be on it tonight.

01:28:38.061 --> 01:28:39.713
It's fucking crazy 'innit?

01:28:39.961 --> 01:28:41.314
Me on a telly.

01:28:43.633 --> 01:28:45.258
What the fuck, Arthur?

01:28:45.775 --> 01:28:46.784
What?

01:28:47.035 --> 01:28:48.044
What?

01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:55.500
It's okay, Garry.

01:28:55.759 --> 01:28:57.201
You can go.

01:28:59.349 --> 01:29:00.753
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:29:05.667 --> 01:29:07.864
Don't look.
Just go.

01:29:19.636 --> 01:29:21.187
Oh, fuck.

01:29:26.239 --> 01:29:28.385
- H- Hey Arthur?
- Yeah?

01:29:29.798 --> 01:29:32.072
Arthur, can you get.....the lock?

01:29:32.097 --> 01:29:33.683
Oh!

01:29:35.127 --> 01:29:36.136
Shit.

01:29:36.638 --> 01:29:38.091
It's alright, Garry.

01:29:48.922 --> 01:29:50.374
- Garry?
- Yeah?

01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:55.457
You’re the only one that’s
ever been nice to me.

01:29:58.056 --> 01:29:59.949
Get out of here.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:30.094
Hey, Arthur!
We need to talk!

01:31:31.767 --> 01:31:34.120
Hey, stop, Arthur!

01:31:39.063 --> 01:31:40.075
Arthur!

01:31:42.558 --> 01:31:44.300
- You fucking---
- Hey, out of the way!

01:31:47.258 --> 01:31:48.511
Move!

01:31:50.503 --> 01:31:52.069
Arthur!

01:31:55.825 --> 01:31:57.369
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:32:03.634 --> 01:32:05.100
Arthur, stop!

01:32:10.021 --> 01:32:11.299
Go! Go!

01:32:18.058 --> 01:32:20.124
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

01:32:27.116 --> 01:32:28.183
Hold that train!

01:32:29.391 --> 01:32:30.458
Hold that train!

01:32:30.941 --> 01:32:31.941
Hold it!

01:32:31.959 --> 01:32:33.283
Open the fucking door!

01:32:33.956 --> 01:32:35.429
Get out! Get out!

01:32:36.283 --> 01:32:38.113
Next stop,--

01:32:51.742 --> 01:32:54.444
- Hey, asshole!
- Better watch it!

01:32:55.287 --> 01:32:57.164
Stand down! Now!

01:33:05.633 --> 01:33:07.720
Police!
Stand down!

01:33:08.352 --> 01:33:10.179
Stand down!

01:33:13.835 --> 01:33:15.454
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh!

01:33:26.027 --> 01:33:28.800
Stop fighting!
Police! Police!

01:33:31.986 --> 01:33:34.348
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

01:33:35.232 --> 01:33:38.424
Police, get down!
Get the fuck down!

01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:51.548
What the--?

01:33:54.253 --> 01:33:55.489
Arthur!

01:33:56.298 --> 01:33:57.705
Hey!

01:33:58.657 --> 01:34:00.296
God, no!

01:34:49.864 --> 01:34:53.469
Two officer on the train were violently
confronted by the crowd tonight

01:34:53.508 --> 01:34:56.614
and they're in serious but stable
condition at Gotham Metropolitan.

01:34:57.165 --> 01:34:59.773
We're going live now to
co-anchor Courtney Weathers

01:34:59.798 --> 01:35:01.888
who's standing by outside
the Bedford park station

01:35:01.913 --> 01:35:03.807
near where the
shooting took place.

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:05.855
Courtney, what's
the scene there?

01:35:11.175 --> 01:35:12.680
- Murray!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:35:12.706 --> 01:35:15.058
-  It's "Mr. Franklin!".
- Oh, come on, Gene.

01:35:15.083 --> 01:35:16.481
That's all bullshit.

01:35:17.447 --> 01:35:19.027
Thank you, Murray.

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.254
I feel like I know you.

01:35:21.944 --> 01:35:23.616
I've been watching
you forever.

01:35:24.141 --> 01:35:25.150
Thank you.

01:35:25.346 --> 01:35:26.675
What's with the face?

01:35:26.768 --> 01:35:28.300
That mean that you we're
part of the protest?

01:35:28.325 --> 01:35:29.913
No. No.

01:35:29.983 --> 01:35:31.972
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

01:35:32.398 --> 01:35:33.899
I don't believe in anything.

01:35:34.636 --> 01:35:36.126
I just thought it would
be good for my act.

01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:38.511
For your act? Didn't you hear
what happened on the subway?

01:35:38.536 --> 01:35:40.829
- Some clown got killed.
- He's aware of that, yeah.

01:35:40.931 --> 01:35:42.534
No, I haven't heard.

01:35:42.749 --> 01:35:44.317
- Yeah?
- You see ,this is what I’m telling you.

01:35:44.342 --> 01:35:46.428
the audience is gonna go
crazy if you put this guy on.

01:35:46.453 --> 01:35:48.681
Maybe-- maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

01:35:48.706 --> 01:35:50.780
Gene, It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

01:35:51.836 --> 01:35:53.632
We're gonna go with it.

01:35:54.244 --> 01:35:55.253
Thank you, Murray.

01:35:55.375 --> 01:35:56.532
Couple of rules though:

01:35:56.696 --> 01:35:58.579
No cursing,
no off-color material,

01:35:58.604 --> 01:36:01.575
- we do a clean show, okay?

01:36:02.162 --> 01:36:03.664
You go on right after Dr. Sally.

01:36:03.792 --> 01:36:05.755
- I love Dr. Sally.
- Good! Good, good.

01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.638
- Well, someone will come
and get you, okay? - Okay.

01:36:08.277 --> 01:36:09.317
Perfect.

01:36:09.418 --> 01:36:10.573
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Murray.

01:36:10.597 --> 01:36:11.610
Okay.

01:36:11.811 --> 01:36:14.244
Hey, Murray...
one small thing.

01:36:14.642 --> 01:36:16.629
- Yeah?
- When you bring me out

01:36:17.117 --> 01:36:18.920
can you introduce
me as "Joker"?

01:36:19.361 --> 01:36:21.041
What's wrong with
your real name?

01:36:21.481 --> 01:36:23.651
That's what you
called me on the show.

01:36:23.882 --> 01:36:25.350
A Joker.

01:36:25.406 --> 01:36:26.415
Do you remember?

01:36:26.651 --> 01:36:28.363
- Did I?
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:36:28.539 --> 01:36:30.999
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, joker it is.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.222
- It's good.
- Thanks, Murray.

01:36:55.052 --> 01:36:58.027
I would try it, you know, but I'm not
sure my wife would let me do it.

01:37:00.349 --> 01:37:02.117
Maybe my next wife.

01:37:05.296 --> 01:37:07.249
You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.

01:37:07.274 --> 01:37:09.389
I'm pretty sure this
guy can use a doctor.

01:37:10.013 --> 01:37:12.163
Oh, does he have
a sexual problem?

01:37:12.188 --> 01:37:14.460
He looks like he's got
a lot of problems.

01:37:15.736 --> 01:37:18.389
Alright, Let's show
that clip one last time.

01:37:25.019 --> 01:37:28.882
I hated school as a kid.

01:37:29.414 --> 01:37:31.777
But my mother
would always say,

01:37:32.674 --> 01:37:34.160
"You should enjoy it.

01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:37.308
One day you'll have
to work for a living."

01:37:37.333 --> 01:37:40.837
"No I won't, Ma.
I'm gonna be a comedian!"

01:37:46.562 --> 01:37:47.563
Okay,

01:37:50.214 --> 01:37:53.471
you may have seen that
clip of our next guest.

01:37:53.496 --> 01:37:55.976
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

01:37:56.001 --> 01:37:59.600
that we're all heartbroken about
what's going on in the city tonight.

01:37:59.757 --> 01:38:02.400
But, this is how he
wanted to come out.

01:38:02.426 --> 01:38:05.663
And, honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.

01:38:05.688 --> 01:38:07.996
So, please welcome "Joker".

01:38:50.194 --> 01:38:52.373
Are you alright, doctor?

01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:57.058
Well, that was...
quite an interest.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:06.676
You okay?

01:39:08.711 --> 01:39:10.166
Oh, yeah.

01:39:10.392 --> 01:39:13.028
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

01:39:15.051 --> 01:39:16.782
Well, that makes one of us.

01:39:23.719 --> 01:39:25.872
So, can you tell
us about this look?

01:39:26.268 --> 01:39:27.838
When we spoke earlier,
you mentioned

01:39:27.863 --> 01:39:30.373
that this look is not a political
statement, is that right?

01:39:30.702 --> 01:39:32.413
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

01:39:32.751 --> 01:39:34.743
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:37.014
And how's that
goin' for ya?

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.750
It's alright. It's alright.
So, I know you're a comedian.

01:39:47.162 --> 01:39:49.074
Have you been working
on any new material?

01:39:49.106 --> 01:39:50.381
You want to tell us a joke?

01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:56.862
Yeah?

01:39:58.947 --> 01:40:00.183
Okay.

01:40:05.953 --> 01:40:07.697
He's got a book.

01:40:08.481 --> 01:40:10.195
A book of jokes.

01:40:19.619 --> 01:40:21.338
Take your time.
We go all night.

01:40:27.034 --> 01:40:29.434
Okay. Okay.
Here's one.

01:40:33.386 --> 01:40:35.024
Knock-knock.

01:40:36.249 --> 01:40:37.838
And you had to look that up?

01:40:44.105 --> 01:40:45.527
I wanted to get it right.

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.211
Knock-knock.

01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:51.134
Who's there?

01:40:52.371 --> 01:40:53.912
It's the Police, ma'am.

01:40:53.927 --> 01:40:55.866
Your son has been hit
by a drunk driver.

01:40:55.953 --> 01:40:57.384
He's dead.

01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:01.703
Oh, no, no, no!

01:41:01.728 --> 01:41:03.767
No, you cannot
joke about that.

01:41:03.792 --> 01:41:05.846
Yeah, that's not funny, Arthur.

01:41:05.871 --> 01:41:08.185
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.

01:41:08.838 --> 01:41:11.027
Okay, I'm s--
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:41:11.324 --> 01:41:12.740
It's just, you know,

01:41:13.287 --> 01:41:16.329
it's been a rough
few weeks, Murray,

01:41:17.213 --> 01:41:18.780
ever since I

01:41:21.648 --> 01:41:23.930
killed those three wall-street guys.

01:41:30.368 --> 01:41:32.133
Okay. I'm waiting
for the punchline.

01:41:33.785 --> 01:41:35.346
There is no punchline.

01:41:36.869 --> 01:41:38.725
It's not a joke.

01:41:44.205 --> 01:41:45.377
You're serious, aren't you?

01:41:45.409 --> 01:41:47.771
You're telling us you killed those
three young men on the subway?

01:41:47.833 --> 01:41:50.669
- M-hm.
- And why should we believe you?

01:41:50.945 --> 01:41:52.597
I've got nothing left to lose.

01:41:54.902 --> 01:41:56.540
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

01:42:00.048 --> 01:42:02.785
My life is nothing but a comedy.

01:42:06.183 --> 01:42:09.634
Let me get this straight, you think
that killing those guys is funny?

01:42:10.367 --> 01:42:11.673
I do.

01:42:12.033 --> 01:42:14.319
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

01:42:14.839 --> 01:42:16.900
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

01:42:17.201 --> 01:42:18.580
Isn't that what they say?

01:42:19.038 --> 01:42:20.505
All of you,

01:42:20.845 --> 01:42:23.309
the system that
knows so much,

01:42:23.747 --> 01:42:26.714
you decide what's
right or wrong

01:42:26.739 --> 01:42:30.763
the same way that you
decide what's funny...

01:42:30.985 --> 01:42:32.401
or not.

01:42:32.758 --> 01:42:34.163
Get him off!

01:42:34.345 --> 01:42:35.794
Well, okay, I--I think

01:42:36.081 --> 01:42:38.178
I might understand that you

01:42:38.574 --> 01:42:40.099
did this to start a movement,

01:42:40.176 --> 01:42:42.236
to become a symbol.

01:42:42.734 --> 01:42:44.387
Come on, Murray,

01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:46.796
do I look like the kind of a clown
that could start a movement?

01:42:47.512 --> 01:42:49.799
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:53.173
Everybody's awful these days.

01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:55.210
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

01:42:55.383 --> 01:42:58.075
Okay. So that's it, you're crazy.
That's your defense

01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:59.668
for killing three
young men?

01:43:00.302 --> 01:43:01.311
Nah.

01:43:01.983 --> 01:43:05.252
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:10.256
Oh! Why is everybody
so upset about these guys?

01:43:11.089 --> 01:43:14.585
If it was me dying on the side-walk,
you'd walk right over me.

01:43:14.632 --> 01:43:17.741
I pass you everyday and you
don't notice me! but these guys,

01:43:17.772 --> 01:43:20.935
what, because Thomas Wayne
went and cried about them on TV?

01:43:20.977 --> 01:43:23.815
Well, you have a problem
with Thomas Wayne,too?

01:43:23.815 --> 01:43:25.434
Yes, I do.

01:43:26.184 --> 01:43:29.312
Have you seen what
it's like out there, Murray?

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.932
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

01:43:33.074 --> 01:43:36.623
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

01:43:36.772 --> 01:43:38.726
Nobody's civil anymore!

01:43:39.064 --> 01:43:42.388
Nobody thinks what
it's like to be the other guy.

01:43:43.337 --> 01:43:45.221
You think men like Thomas Wayne

01:43:45.316 --> 01:43:48.004
ever think what it's like
to be someone like me?

01:43:48.272 --> 01:43:50.812
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:54.129
They think that we'll just
sit there and take it

01:43:54.247 --> 01:43:55.783
like good little boys!

01:43:55.845 --> 01:43:58.168
That we won't
werewolf and go wild.

01:43:58.347 --> 01:43:59.562
You finished?

01:43:59.873 --> 01:44:02.171
I mean, there is so much
self-pity, Arthur.

01:44:02.414 --> 01:44:05.435
You sound like you're making
excuses for killing those young men.

01:44:05.637 --> 01:44:08.810
Not everybody- and I'll tell you this-
not everyone is awful.

01:44:10.927 --> 01:44:13.282
- But you're awful, Murray.
- Me?

01:44:13.446 --> 01:44:15.830
I'm awful? Oh, yeah?
How am I awful?

01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:19.817
Playing my video,

01:44:21.134 --> 01:44:22.750
inviting me on the show---

01:44:24.199 --> 01:44:26.521
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

01:44:27.577 --> 01:44:29.517
You're just like the rest of 'em.

01:44:29.633 --> 01:44:31.729
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:34.328
Look what happened because
of what you did, what it led to.

01:44:34.696 --> 01:44:36.122
There are riots out there.

01:44:36.247 --> 01:44:38.983
Two policemen are in critical
condition and you're laughing.

01:44:39.008 --> 01:44:41.418
You're laughing.
Someone was killed today

01:44:42.477 --> 01:44:43.993
because of what you did.

01:44:44.018 --> 01:44:45.290
I know.

01:44:48.051 --> 01:44:49.510
How about a another joke, Murray?

01:44:49.535 --> 01:44:51.195
No, I think we got
enough of your jokes.

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:52.783
- What do you get..
- I don't think so.

01:44:52.808 --> 01:44:56.319
..when you cross a mentally-ill
loner with a society

01:44:56.344 --> 01:44:58.692
that abandons him and
treats him like trash?

01:44:58.717 --> 01:44:59.870
Call the police, Gene.

01:44:59.895 --> 01:45:01.264
- I'll tell you what you get.
- Call the police!

01:45:01.289 --> 01:45:03.031
You get what you
fucking deserve!

01:45:39.141 --> 01:45:41.765
Good night.
And always remember.

01:45:42.145 --> 01:45:44.237
That's--

01:45:47.746 --> 01:45:49.107
Breaking news.

01:45:49.257 --> 01:45:51.875
Popular TV talk show host
Murray Franklin was

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:55.227
shot dead tonight on the live telecast
of his program by one of his guests.

01:45:55.252 --> 01:45:59.441
--the man who was introduced by Franklin
as "Joker" is currently under arrest--

01:45:59.466 --> 01:46:02.964
-- The police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio--

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:06.638
- ...when asking him what he did..
- ...merely just a punchline to a joke...

01:46:06.663 --> 01:46:08.858
- Would you like another joke?
- I don't think so.

01:46:12.308 --> 01:46:15.812
...with the society that abandons him
and treats him like trash.

01:46:20.159 --> 01:46:23.581
If it was me dying on the side-walk,
you'd walk right over me!

01:46:23.798 --> 01:46:26.215
To all of those who have been
ignored by the system--

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.052
--and as you can see,
Gotham is burning---

01:47:24.065 --> 01:47:26.363
Stop laughing you freak.
This isn't funny.

01:47:26.617 --> 01:47:29.216
We have the whole fucking city's
on fire because of what you did.

01:47:30.328 --> 01:47:34.185
All units, fire reported.
North of ally.

01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:36.216
I know.

01:47:37.279 --> 01:47:39.322
Isn't it beautiful?

01:49:22.266 --> 01:49:23.911
Let's go over there.

01:49:41.667 --> 01:49:42.958
Hey, Wayne.

01:49:43.833 --> 01:49:45.673
You get what you
fucking deserve.

01:49:45.698 --> 01:49:46.998
No, pal!

01:50:27.366 --> 01:50:29.600
Joker!

01:50:29.625 --> 01:50:31.863
Joker!

01:53:10.926 --> 01:53:12.522
What's so funny?

01:53:14.617 --> 01:53:16.169
I just think--

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:18.789
--just thinking of this joke.

01:53:37.773 --> 01:53:39.245
You wanna tell it to me?

01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:47.292
