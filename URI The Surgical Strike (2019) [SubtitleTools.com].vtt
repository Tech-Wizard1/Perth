"This time when I come home, "

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.920
"I'll buy you a motorcycle."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.080
"I'll make you wear the helmet
and hop on the back seat"

"and race my motorcycle ahead."

"O, Sweetheart...

"My dear sweetheart."

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.640
"O darling,
don't hold on too hard."

"I'll buy a car for you instead."

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.600
Get back.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.680
Get back.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.880
Let's go... Let's go.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.400
Sartaj.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.160
Sir.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.320
Kailang.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.360
Kailang accompanied by Ebohal.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.200
Along with 70-80 terrorists of KYKL...

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.960
Double of what we had expected.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.400
Sir, shall we radio-in the B-team?

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.880
Negative.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.680
They won't get here before dawn.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.560
We'll lose the element of surprise.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.680
We might not get
this opportunity again...

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.720
when all the terrorists of Nagaland
and Manipur have assembled in one place.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.720
Karan.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.960
Form an outer perimeter
with 10 commandos.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.360
Mainly snipers.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.680
Sartaj, the other commandos and I, will
move in from the left and right flank...

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.200
for a direct assault.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.200
You will handle any terrorist
who gets out of our circle.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.600
No terrorist gets out alive.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.720
Copy.
- Copy.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.160
Copy.
- Good. Best of luck.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.480
Best of luck.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.080
Sartaj.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.360
Anyone spot Kailang?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.480
Negative Sir.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.440
Commandos!
- Yes, sir!

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.880
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.360
I said how is the spirit?
- High, sir!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.840
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.440
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.480
What is Major Vihaan's background?

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.800
He's an NDA Topper.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.480
Para-Commando Gold Medallist.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.240
His father; Col. Meher Singh Shergill.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.480
Was martyred in the Kargil war,
in Tololing.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.760
Posthumous, he was
honoured with the Mahavir Chakra.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.960
After being trained
for the Special Forces...

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.480
Vihaan was posted in Kashmir,
Jaisalmer, and Manipur.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.840
He was also responsible for the on-ground
planning of the North-Eastern mission.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.920
Boys!

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.880
Major Vihaan Shergill.
- Fantastic.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.120
He headed this operation, sir.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.240
Donor to meet you too, sir.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.800
Major Karan.
- Very proud of you, officer.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.240
Thank you, sir.
- Well done.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.800
Capt. Sartaj.
- Sartaj.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.800
Thank you, sir.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.000
Your team's bravery and skill...

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.200
has put a stop on the movements
of the North Eastern Terrorism.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.080
We're very proud of you.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.160
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.840
We just received a word from RAW...

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.560
that the remaining terrorist groups
want to compromise with us.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.320
After the Special Forces mission,

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.080
they have no choice
but to compromise with us.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.040
Vihaan.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.600
General. Arjun mentioned that
you've put in a request for...

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.960
pre-mature retirement
on compassionate grounds.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.480
Why? What's wrong?

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.760
Sir...

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.920
my mother has Alzheimer's.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.880
Stage 6.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.760
Her memory is fading by the day.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.960
And, she hasn't been
keeping well either.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.880
I've been posted
in the Eastern Command,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.640
and she lives here
in Delhi with my sister.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.800
I would like to spend some time
with her before she forgets me too.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.960
Bravo.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.200
You're a good son who wants
to take care of his mother.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.280
But it's also important to
take care of your country.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.040
After all, this country
is also our mother.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.880
Isn't there a
way other than retirement?

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.360
There is.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.880
What if we transfer you
to the Army Headquarters in Delhi?

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.520
You'll stay close to your mother,
and us too.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.120
What say?

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.920
Right, sir.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.200
Great.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.360
Mr. Govind.
- Sir.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.560
Arrange a nurse for his mother
who will stay with her 24 hours.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.600
Sure.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.440
Well...

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.560
Why don't you all
start with dinner..

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.080
Everyone must be hungry.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.640
Doesn't matter how many times you
read that report,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.400
nothing will change.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.960
I have just one request.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.240
When I get very sick,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.240
don't dump me in some hospital.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.400
Mom, no one's taking
you to any hospital.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.320
I feel very afraid when I am alone.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.440
Take your pills.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.600
Here you go.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.960
Take it.
- Neha's promised me...

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.160
Mom...

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.200
I am trying my best.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.840
I swear.
- I know.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.640
I know you're trying your best.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.360
Mom, take your pills.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.480
May I?

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.720
Hi, uncle.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.120
What took you so long to open the door?
- Sorry.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.360
These are all of mom's clothes.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760
The only thing left
now are the books.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.480
I will bring them over later. Okay.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.520
Oh yes, her medicine.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.560
Did you give her the medicines?
- Just did.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.200
Where is she?
- Inside.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.160
Okay.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.960
Uncle?

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.480
At what age did
you get a black belt?

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.240
16.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.240
See this?

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.200
It's a Green belt.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.040
I'll get my black belt
in a couple of years.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.480
Then you better
be careful around me.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.800
And don't make me lose my temper.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.640
So what are your plans after
getting the black belt, Ms. Karate?

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.520
Firstly,
I'll join the army like uncle.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.120
And then become India's
First Female Army General.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.040
Bravo.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.560
Uncle's sycophant!

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.720
Because your father's a clown,
isn't he?

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.480
You don't think he's
an officer, do you?

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.720
Suhana, go get the scissors.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.160
Scissors.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.000
Vihaan, please go help Karan.
- Why?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.680
He's made a real mess
planning your party.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.600
Oh, God.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.200
Our home looks like a
couple of grenades went off.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.480
Seriously.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.360
Scissors.
- Thank you.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.000
Let's go meet your papa.
- Come on.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.520
Mom's nurse will be arriving soon.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.640
The guest room is ready for her...

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.480
Vihaan.
- Yes, mom.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.800
When did you arrive?

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.840
He just arrived today, mom.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.440
He wanted to surprise you.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.840
How long are you planning to stay?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.840
10 days.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.440
He's planning to take
you to aunt Rajni's house.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.920
In Dehradun.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.160
You better leave.
Karan's waiting for you, okay.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.880
Mom, did you watch
your favourite show?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.040
Suhana, go finish your homework.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.920
Did you eat?

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.200
I am really famished. Let's eat.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.600
Uncle. Let's go.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.120
Uncle, Papa taught me
your battalion's war cry.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.600
Really? Tell me.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.480
Courage and competence in war,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.200
sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.720
Come on... You call that a war cry?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.800
When you shout out a war cry...

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.440
it should make the
soldier's blood boil.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.120
And your enemies should
shiver in their boots.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.480
That's a war cry.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.920
And start eating
eggs for breakfast.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.760
No more salads like your mom!

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.680
Get changed,
And then we can do your homework.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.600
Go.
- Okay.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.240
Sartaj?

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.200
Didn't you have a date today?

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.440
Why didn't you go?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.880
You didn't hear?

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.960
What happened?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.440
He got all dressed up,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.080
wore Armani perfume...

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.800
and was about to leave when he suddenly
gets a message from his girlfriend.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.560
Saying "I am tired of
this relationship, its over."

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.040
I am really sorry, I didn't know.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.280
I am not finished yet.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.680
A little later she
messaged him again.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.400
Saying "Sorry sweetheart, this
message got sent to you by mistake."

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.680
These uptown girls I tell you...

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.160
uptown...

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.160
But anyway...

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.440
How are you going to
manage staff work in Delhi?

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.480
A man like you will go
crazy pushing pen in South Block.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.040
Your planning has never failed
in any of the missions.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.040
Sir, you're needed at the border,
not in Delhi.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.080
Look, every soldier
has to this job as well.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.960
And, you both know
that I have to do this.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.120
Now stop making these sad faces
and pass me the cottage cheese.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.960
Did mom's reports come in?
- They did.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.360
It's spreading aggressively now.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.480
Hope you are having a good time.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.120
Please help yourself, guys.
- Karan.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.400
Here's your drink.
- Thank you.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.080
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.760
This is nothing, Capt. Zeeshan.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.280
Vihaan's dad in fact brewed
the best brandy in the world.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.640
And often after returning from school
we would help ourselves to it..

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.800
Soon he found
out and suspected us.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.320
So, in order to save
ourselves from the beating...

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.560
we transferred half of the
brandy to our school water bottle.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.360
And, we passed urine in the half empty
brandy bottle to make it look full.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.720
Not us, just him.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.640
And unfortunately, the very same night,
his Titu uncle flew in from abroad.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.480
To try the latest batch of brandy.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.960
He took one sip and, Listen. Listen.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.040
He took one sip and said...

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.280
"Exquisite!"

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.840
Hello, sir.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.400
When did she fall asleep?
- A little while ago.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.080
Did she take her pills?
- Yes, sir.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.520
She has a habit of waking
up in the middle of the night.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.280
If you need anything,
feel free to tell me.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.760
I'll be right here.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.560
Don't worry, sir. It's my job.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.520
And, in case you want to rest,
there's the guest room.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.360
No problem, sir. I am fine.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.920
Thank you.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.640
What is your name?
- Jasmine.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.480
Jasmine?
- Jasmine Almeida.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.360
Jasmine Almeida. Sit.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.440
Sit.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.160
Stop spreading these
lies immediately!

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.240
You've turned this into a joke.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.520
Everyone knows that
we're a peace-loving nation.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.640
You blame us for every
trivial attack in your country.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.960
I want evidence!

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.920
Evidence!?

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.160
What more proof do you need, sir?

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.720
What you're saying is baseless.
Absolutely baseless.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.960
Three terrorists infiltrated
our border through the Ravi river.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.960
They opened fire on
a Punjab Roadways bus.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.080
Some were injured...

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.920
But the driver kept his head
straight and didn't stop the bus...

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.600
and drove straight
to the Government Hospital.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.760
Where are the terrorists now?

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.400
Right now they are hiding in
an under-construction building...

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.640
near Dina Nagar Police Station.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.320
But the Swat Team have
already started their operation.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.960
Keep NSG on standby.
- Okay, sir.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.320
Which terrorist group
do they belong to?

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.160
According to our sources,
these men are from Lashkar.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.760
Do we know how many
people have died?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.120
Four civilians are dead.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.120
And 11 are still serious.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.560
Sir. IEDs were discovered
at the Pathankot Railway tracks.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.240
There's a probability
of finding more.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.120
Sir...

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.680
Please excuse me.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.440
Sir.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.360
The Punjab Swat Team
has arrived on the spot.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.440
IEDs were recovered from railway
tracks between Pathankot and Amritsar.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.120
Sorry, sir.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.880
We're doing our best.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.880
Yes, sir.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.440
"O Life..."

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:06.520
"Why was there was
always a rift between us?"

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.760
"O Life..."

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:16.160
"Together we took care
of all the complaints we had."

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.200
"O Life..."

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:30.080
"Why was there
always a rift between us?"

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.520
"O Life..."

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:39.600
"Together we took care
of all the complaints we had."

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.200
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.080
"now you must try following me."

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.240
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.400
"now you must try following me."

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.320
"And away I go... Away I go..."

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:06.440
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.720
"And away I go... Away I go..."

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.680
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.880
"A part of me is still here..."

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.160
"and other part
is somewhere else."

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.160
"We've met countless times before."

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.840
"Yet every time we meet
you feel like a stranger."

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.480
"My destination is right here..."

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.200
"yet my path seems complicated."

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.800
"No matter how many times
I try to walk towards you..."

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.600
"but the distance
never seems closer."

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.240
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.840
"now you must try following me."

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.120
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.320
"now you must try following me."

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:08.320
"And away I go... Away I go..."

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.280
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.720
"And away I go... Away I go..."

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.520
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.360
"A part of me is still here..."

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.880
"and other part
is somewhere else."

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.920
"A part of me is still here..."

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.160
"and other part
is somewhere else."

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.960
"O Life..."

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.280
It's been more than 16 hours now

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.320
and yet there seems
no respite from this encounter.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:08.600
The ADI building is being targeted
by rocket launchers and grenades.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.240
And Fire has broken out
in one part of the building.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.560
We've learned from our sources that

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.560
two soldiers have been injured...

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.640
although we have
no confirmed information.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.400
And the sound of the explosions...

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.120
Jai Hind, sir.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.480
Why are you here?

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.680
Sir, my case is
under investigation.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.400
My first posting was
in Srinagar in July 2014.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.920
I was just getting
to know my work when...

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.520
there was a huge deluge
in the first week of September...

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.280
and the dam on Jhelum broke.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.600
Water started to
rise at an alarming rate...

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.320
in the low lying
areas of Srinagar.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.360
All the MI-17 and Dhruv
pilots immediately...

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.120
engaged in a sortie mission.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:43.360
Without any rest or food, we started
rescuing people from low lying areas.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.280
On the 7th night at 3 am, we
received a distress call from Rajbagh.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.560
A 7-year-old child
was badly injured...

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.640
and stuck on the roof
of her house along with her mother.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.560
There was almost no visibility
due to the rain.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.960
As a result, the Commander cancelled
all rescue missions till dawn.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.920
But somehow I couldn't
get that child out of my head.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.520
I had to do something.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.600
Sabiya and Zooni.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.240
Is anyone from your family
in the Defence forces?

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.080
Dad? Mom? Brother?

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.000
No, sir.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.760
My husband was.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.440
Capt. Jaskirat Singh Rangi.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.000
Seasoned Punjab Regiment.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.080
He died in an ambush
at the Naushera Sector.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.680
Jaskirat was a big patriot.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.480
The only thing I
am afraid of now is...

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.800
whether I'll ever get to prove
my patriotism to Jaskirat or not...

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.880
Mom.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:27.920
Mom.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.200
Mom.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.800
Mom.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.360
Jasmine.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.840
Yes. Yes.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.800
How's your acidity now?

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.800
Are you taking your pills on time?

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.280
Okay, I am going to call you back.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.320
Where's mom?
- Inside. Sleeping.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.160
Stay here.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.440
Peaceful-Peacefuller.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.640
More peaceful.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.840
Most Peaceful...
- Neha, did mom come here?

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.960
No.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.600
Oh, God.
- Mom.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.440
I am extremely sorry.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.920
I am sorry.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.200
It was very urgent.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.760
I wouldn't have if
it wasn't an emergency,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.440
You know me.
I would have never taken that call.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.080
I am extremely...
- I know...

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.480
What is your real name?

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.200
Jasmine Almeida...
- What is your real name, Jasmine?

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.280
Sir, I just told you.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.320
Where's my mom?
- Vihaan...

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.920
Relax.
- One second, Neha. One second.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.360
I don't...
- Now you listen to me.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.400
Neither my family, nor
I need protection of any kind.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.080
I am quite capable of
protecting them &amp; myself!

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.440
And I definitely don't need an
incompetent and fake nurse like you.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.720
So tell your Intelligence
Department...

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.560
to find my mom
by hook or by crook,

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.640
and bring her home.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.640
Do it!

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.720
Can I take it?
- Yes, you can.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.320
Hello.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:36:59.920
Where?

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.320
Okay.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.760
Our agents found Mrs. Suhasini
under the Dwarka bridge.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.160
The day I came here I put
GPS tags on all her clothes...

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.120
so that we can track
her every movement.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.680
She should be home soon.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.320
I might be an incompetent nurse,
But I am a damn good agent, sir.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.800
I am sorry.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.320
She should be home soon.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.520
Jai Hind, sir.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.840
Jai Hind.
- There's still time for breakfast.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.120
Can we get tea?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.760
Shaqeel.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.680
Shaqeel.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.320
Shaqeel.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.400
Let's go there.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.400
That side. Run.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.640
Go on. Go.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.160
They are heavily armed.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.640
Around 4-5 terrorists.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.040
Sir.
- What position?

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.400
Two are behind the West Wing.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.440
Major Awasthi's team
has opened counter-fire.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.600
One of them is
on the Admin block...

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.160
and the other near the T6 wall.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.040
Sartaj.
- Sir.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.920
Fetch me my Draganov
from the Transit room.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.800
I'll blow their bloody
brains out from right here.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:04.880
Hurry.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.640
Rohit. Thapa.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.800
Yes sir.
- Sir.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.800
Cover me.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.680
Sartaj, Go through the West Wing
and reach at the fuel depot.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.720
And you two rendezvous
near the T6 bunker.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.600
Sir.
- Best of luck, guys.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.600
Go. Go. Go.
- Yes, sir.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.480
Stop! Stop!

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.800
Stop firing!
- Stop firing!

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:23.640
Courage and competence in war.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.640
Sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.960
Sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.120
This is no time to think
about the UN or USA's opinion.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:55.480
It's time we send a message to Pakistan
in the language they understand.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.200
If we don't give a fitting
reply for this cowardly attack...

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.480
then it will shatter the morale
of our army and our civilians.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.960
People will lose
faith in our government.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.840
Sir, we can prepare
for war in three days.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.600
I can send our tanks and heavy
artillery under 8 hours to the LC.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.760
I think we should
dishonour the Indus Treaty.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.400
If ISI gets pressurized
by Pakistani citizens

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.800
then maybe they will
lessen their terrorist attacks.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.280
Pakistan is under the ISI.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.880
The ISI is not under Pakistan.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.400
They might let their
people starve to death...

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.880
But never stop funding terrorism.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.800
We must think of a better option.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.040
Govind.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.160
Govind.

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.440
A surgical strike, sir.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.880
Surgical strike.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.960
Infiltrate POK and annihilate
their terrorist launchpads...

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.560
their hidden terrorists,
their handlers, and guides.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.880
And looking at Pakistan's
nature they will never admit...

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.920
that terrorists
are breeding on their land.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.280
So, if there are no terrorists, then
there's no question of a strike, right?

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.120
And, since there's no strike, there's no
point of war or international pressure.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.600
Most important...

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:18.360
this is our biggest opportunity
to strike back for Uri.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.480
Doesn't a surgical strike
sound a bit dangerous?

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.160
We can use our jet fighters to bomb
some of their bunkers near the LC.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.520
During the Munich Olympics, PLO
terrorists killed Israeli athletes.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.200
But Israel didn't strike back by
just firing a couple of missiles.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.560
They engaged Operation
'Wrath of God'.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.120
They hunted down every single terrorist,

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.920
dragged them from their home
and killed them.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.680
In the history of India, we have
never attacked any country first.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.640
And Pakistan has been taking advantage
of our nature from the beginning.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.720
1947, '65, '71... '99...

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.600
In fact, sir. Our tolerance
is being mistaken as our weakness.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.320
This is our chance to
instil fear in their hearts.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.760
Make them believe that India
will not take things lying down.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.040
This is a New India.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.880
We will infiltrate them
and hit them where it hurts.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.960
Ravinder...

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.480
We have no enmity with
the Pakistani population.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.400
Our war is against terrorism.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.880
I think Govind is right.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.600
Arjun.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.280
I think it's a good idea, sir.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.720
Fine...

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.640
In 10 days we'll carry out the most
lethal surgical strike in Pakistan.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.680
Ravinder, you prepare
a team along with Arjun.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.120
And you will lead this mission.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.960
You will do all the planning.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.280
And you will update
me about their progress every day.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.760
Everyone else keeps the
Pakistani authorities busy.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.120
Give them evidence
of the Uri attack.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.240
Ask them for an explanation.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.560
But at no cost should
anyone get a whiff of our plan.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.920
Remember...

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.840
these meetings
shouldn't be logged.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.320
Did you eat?

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.960
No, sir. Don't feel like it.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.160
Wait, I'll get something.
- No, sir.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.920
I am in a hurry.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.440
I... have received my orders.

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.560
They are planning
an operation in Kashmir.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.640
I don't know the details, but...

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.240
I guess...

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.760
they are planning
to strike back to avenge Uri.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.600
Karan sir always said...

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.200
not a single man can die
when Vihaan's around.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.720
He'll even fight
with Death to save us.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.040
I really wish you were
there to lead us, sir.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.960
I found two dirty shirts
amongst Karan's stuff.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.800
And I don't know what to do.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.520
I don't want to wash them

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.520
or hand them over to someone else.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.840
I can still feel his
essence in them, Vihaan.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.360
Sir, you once mentioned
in your lecture...

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.200
there exists a thin line between
responsible and irresponsible.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.360
I don't want to be on
the other side of that line.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.640
If I don't fight for my men,
my country now...

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.960
then I'll be irresponsible
in my own opinion.

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.040
And I won't be able
to live with that.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.360
I promise you, sir, you can send me
to any corner of this world to fight.

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.480
I will bring all my soldiers
back safe and sound.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.640
Sir, let me be a part
of this mission in Kashmir.

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.400
I request you, sir. Please.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.440
Vihaan,

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.120
in 8 days you're going to
conduct a surgical strike in POK.

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.720
Tomorrow morning Lt. Gn. Grewal

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.240
will brief you about this operation.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.360
You will do the entire
on ground planning with him.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.920
Prepare the best team you can.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.760
And revert back to me by the 23rd night
with each and every detail.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.160
Understood, sir.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.800
I wish you all the best.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.120
Thank you very much, sir.

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.760
I've scoured these
hills for 40 years.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.640
When I close my eyes,
I don't see my children's faces.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.840
I see Kashmir's
territorial map instead.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.200
And that's why Vihaan,

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.320
it will be easy to enter POK.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.240
But what will be difficult
is getting out after the attack.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.880
I understand, sir.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.360
We will plan for everything.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.920
Did you finalize the team?

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.280
Out of the soldiers
that died in the Uri attack...

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.280
most of them belonged
to the Dogra and Bihar Regiment.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.560
My advice is that

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:10.400
we should include this regiment's
special team in this mission as well.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.480
To win a war,
very often a soldier's emotions,

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.760
are more important than his training.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.200
I want to put their anger
and passion to the right use.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.840
At ease.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.640
Commandos.

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.200
My name is Major Vihaan Shergill.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.840
And that's Capt. Sartaj.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.000
Please take your phones out.

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.440
Now send a text to your family.

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.200
Saying that you'll be in Udhampur till
the morning of the 29th of September...

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.560
for a special tactical training.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:02.160
And you won't be allowed to communicate
with anyone during this training.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.200
As a result,

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.040
you'll keep your phones
switched off for the next 7 days.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.080
Send it.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.400
Is it sent?
- Yes, sir.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.520
Good. Sartaj.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.960
Now you will all put
your phones in this bag.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.760
And your phones will be returned to you
only on the morning of 29th September.

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.080
What I am going to tell you next...

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.280
shall never be mentioned
again until your last breath.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.240
On the night of 28th September...

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.320
I will give you a chance to avenge our
brothers who died in the Uri attack.

00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.160
Just like those coward
terrorists brutally killed...

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.360
our unarmed brothers
in their sleep...

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.840
we will give them a fitting reply...

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.080
A chance to behead them.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.800
Are you ready for this mission?
- Yes, sir.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.480
Is your blood boiling for revenge?
- Yes, sir.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.920
Commandos.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.440
Who are we?
- Indian army, sir!

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.720
The Indian Army did not start this war
but we will bloody hell finish it.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.760
Yes, sir!

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.280
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.640
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.080
I said how is the spirit?
- High, sir!

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.080
Good!

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.480
Yes, sir.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.280
It's completely our fault.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.560
We'll definitely find out.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.360
We'll have to.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.800
Don't worry.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.440
Goodbye.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.280
You guys are bunch of stupid
lowlife nincompoops.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.200
You don't have kids, right?

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.040
Don't even try.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.200
For the past one month
I've been saying...

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.560
that there's a mole in our office who
has been syphoning information to India.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.440
And you guys can't find him.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.360
I swear.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.400
I am starting to feel that...

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.360
that could it be one of you?

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.200
Can you even imagine
the pressure on me?

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.600
One week...

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.840
If you don't find
that guy in a week,

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:48.520
I'll have one of
you for dinner, and...

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.960
I won't even burp.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.200
Don't just stand there
staring at my face.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280
Get lost.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.680
And Karim, give that file to me.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.240
Stupid idiots.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.720
Mother, it's me.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.240
Hello. How are you?

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.240
You wanted Bilqis
aunt's number, right?

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.280
Take a pen and note it down.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.120
34...

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.360
49...

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160
58...

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.080
8... 74...

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680
2201...

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.440
2

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.160
Yes..

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.040
No, I'm feeling a little acidic.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.760
The indigestion
is causing me to burp.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.720
My stomach is not doing so well.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.440
Also note down
Munnu uncle's number.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.840
Sir, we got the coordinates.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.840
There's a total of seven locations,
all close to LC.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.560
We'll have to physically find the location
of their launchpads in these areas.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.680
Call Srinivas at ISRO.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.440
The pictures from Tripura, Assam
are not clear due to heavy rains.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.720
Hello.
- Govind speaking.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800
Bharadwaj.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.680
Hi, Govind. Tell me.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.280
Listen, I'm sending
you some coordinates.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.440
I want you to position the
RISAT 1 or the RISAT 2 satellite

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.120
over these coordinates
for the next six days.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.080
And don't move them, come what may.
- Okay.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.400
Secondly, relay all the
images directly to Raisina Hills.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.760
We have only two hours.
- Okay.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.240
You will personally scan every
location with the Army Intelligence.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:07.000
only when we have every
detail about the all the locations.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200
Correct?
- Yes, sir.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.480
Done, sir.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.720
Send this feed directly
to Raisina Hills.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.880
Sir. We have the feed.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.080
Pallavi.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.800
Pallavi Sharma.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.560
You asked me my real name that day.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.800
I am really sorry about that day.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.240
It's okay.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.760
In fact, even I might have reacted
the same way if I was in your place.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560
How is your mom?

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.600
She is...

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.000
She is fine.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.160
Neha is staying with her.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.640
We've also appointed a
full-time nurse, so let's see.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.440
I hope she's better than me.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.320
I think its time. We should get going.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.320
I'll look into this.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.360
Sir.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.240
Sir.
- Vihaan. Come, sit.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.880
Have you selected your team?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.920
And what about their advanced
tactical commando training?

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.440
It's begun, sir.
- Good.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.960
Pallavi. You can begin.
- Sir.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.440
Sir, we've confirmed 5 launchpads
of Hizbul, Lashkar, and Jaish.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.920
Two in Lipa Valley.
Two in Kel.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.160
And one in Bhimber.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.840
These launchpads were easy to find
because they were in isolated areas.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.200
And the remaining two are...

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.720
possibly located in the populated
areas of the Muzaffarabad district.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.840
Identifying the exact
location through satellites

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.160
in a crowded area
is a little difficult.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.080
I will check at DRDO tomorrow,

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.640
whether they can help us
in finding the launchpads.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.840
And Pallavi, keep giving Vihaan all
the details about these launchpads. - Sir.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.400
Vihaan, any suggestion or question?

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.560
Which of these launchpads
were used for the Uri attack?

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.800
We believe that the attackers came from
one of the launchpads in Muzaffarabad.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.640
And who was the
handler of that attack?

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.040
We still don't have any
information on that. Sorry.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.960
These Sigma 5 drones
are our latest invention.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.080
Developed along with...

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.360
Israeli intelligence.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.920
Sir,

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.360
their range is
close to 50 kilometres.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.320
And they can fly as low
as 2 kilometres above ground.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.480
That's fine, Brian,

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.240
but how close can it come to the ground,
without getting detected.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:31.920
Meaning?

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.480
Meaning I want a drone that can
fly outside our enemy's window...

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.800
without getting detected.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.320
Sir, that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.880
I thought as much.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.440
Sir, he's our intern.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.320
What's your name, son?
- Ishaan.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.920
Ishaan Wattal, sir.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.360
What is this?

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.640
Sir, it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.840
Shaped like an eagle.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.040
What is it called?
- Garuda.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.400
Garuda. Based on Vishnu Puran.
- Ahh... Vishnu Puran.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.880
Sorry, since there are already
so many projects underway...

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.720
I use the spare parts
to pass some time. That's it.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.520
Ishaan, make it fly. Come.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:26.960
Sorry, sir.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.880
Sir.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.960
Sir, when I say so
you must run fast

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.680
and throw the Garuda
in the air with full force.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.120
Just a minute, sir.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.360
Raise your hand.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.440
Higher, sir.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.160
A little more.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840
Sorry, sir.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.440
Sir, 3...

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.840
2...

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.560
1...

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.080
What's the range?

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.240
Sir, it can fly up to
a distance of 12 kilometres...

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.360
and its got four hours of
battery backup on a single charge.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.960
Infrared and night vision enabled.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.000
It has a 16-megapixel camera
and 7.2x digital zoom.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.920
And it can also hover at one
place for take-off and landing...

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.880
Like...

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.000
this.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.800
If it can hover at one
place for taking off and landing,

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.200
then why did you make Brian run.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.560
Brian.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.640
I need four such
Garudas by tomorrow.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.240
Tomorrow?

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.040
Sir, this is just a prototype which
this kid has made just to pass time.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.960
It hasn't been commissioned
yet and the R&amp;D for it...

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.720
Can four such Garudas
be made by tomorrow?

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.520
We can if the entire team chips in.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.440
Good. Brian, stop everything else

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:39.480
and start a separate assembly line, and
put all your technicians to work on this.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.960
Tomorrow afternoon I want Ishaan on a
flight to Kashmir along with four Garudas.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.480
Okay.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.800
You might have just
won us the war, son.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.560
Good job.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.720
Thank... Sorry, sir.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.520
Sir.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.720
Time to prove your
patriotism to Jaskirat.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.280
You're going to be my pilot, Seerat.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.680
Sir...

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.360
Excuse me.
- Yes.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.400
Hello. - The army has arrested
two guides in Baramulla.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.200
Chances are they have
information about the Uri attack.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360
Govind sir wants both of
us involved in the interrogation.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.480
When are you leaving?
- 2 hours.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560
Palam Air Force Base.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.800
Who was the handler for the
Uri attack?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.320
Where was it planned?

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.040
I don't know anything, madam.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.880
I sell nuts in Batmaylu...

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.360
Make another excuse
and I will burst your nuts.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.440
Believe me, madam...

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.040
Oh Mother...

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.400
Oh Mother...

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.400
Who was involved in the Uri attack?
I want names.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.840
Who was involved?

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.480
Who was the handler
for the Uri attack?

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.120
Oh Mother...
- Farooq, I need names.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.000
Oh Mother...

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.520
Who were they?
- Oh Mother...

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.440
Oh Mother...

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080
Who he is?

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760
He's my brother?

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.320
What's his name?

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.800
Faizal.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040
Look Faizal,

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.200
we're running out of time.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.160
Your brother has two options.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:35.960
First,

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.680
he politely gives us the
name of the handler of the Uri attack.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:41.960
Second,

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.720
I can spill your guts out.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.440
Some tea?

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.720
No. Stop him, ma'am.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.440
Please stop him, madam.
He's just a kid.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.200
He will die, madam.
He's just a kid.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.600
Madam.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.640
Madam...

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.360
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.400
Idris.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.640
Idris Qayoom Al Baghdadi.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.640
He made the plan.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.800
And Jabbar Firozi was the handler.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.360
This is Idris and that's Jabbar.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.480
They were the planners
and handlers for the attack...

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.080
on Uri and on
Pampore before that.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.120
Idris is from Sialkot
and Jabbar is from Gilgit.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.800
Seven years ago they met in one of the
training camps of Jaish-e-Mohammad...

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.040
and a few years later,
under the supervision of Jaish...

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.360
they started their own
highly specialized terrorist group.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.400
Sirat-UL-Jannat.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.640
Their B-2 training center and
Launchpad is in the Chakothi village...

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.920
which is near the Aman Setu ridge
and Muzaffarabad district.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.400
Their guides use the natural caves
situated in the jungles around them to...

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.040
infiltrate the terrorists into India.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.200
We've given the army
the locations of these caves.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.800
They are keeping
a watch on these caves.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.400
Four UAVs will be sent to
Kashmir tomorrow from the DRDO...

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.360
for additional surveillance.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.840
You must increase shelling
at the LC from tomorrow.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.800
And keep increasing the intensity
gradually so that on the night of 28th...

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.960
we reach the
peak of our shelling.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.840
Especially in the areas

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.440
from where our soldiers
will infiltrate into POK.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:44.160
"I will fight."

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.720
"I will fight."

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:53.480
"The fire in my blood
makes me want to fight."

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.560
"I will go to any lengths.
That's my heart's desire."

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:03.840
"A passionate soul is ready to die
for his country. He is fearless."

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.040
"The enemies are afraid of him."

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.880
"A soldier fights till his last breath."

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.400
"He faces death fearlessly
and leaves the enemies trembling."

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.720
"I will fight."

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.400
There are some boulders
here where you can hide...

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.160
but a Pakistani forward post is
at a distance of 60 meters from here.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.040
Take the flight recorders
out of all the choppers.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.760
And color it the same
way as the Pakistani Air Force.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.360
"Our hearts are lit up
with our passion."

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:49.640
"We are not afraid of holding
the flames in our hand."

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.480
"We will do something admirable."

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.520
"And set a good example
for the world."

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.440
"I will fight..."

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.880
"It's the burning desire
of my heart to go to any lengths."

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.720
"A soldier never gives up
even till his last breath."

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.960
"He embraces danger
and brings down his enemies."

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.120
"A brave heart is ready to die
for his country. He is heroic."

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:32.800
"He embraces death
and doesn't spare his enemies."

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.920
As of 0900 hours,
India has intensified the shelling.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.840
I guess India is still looking

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.120
for a befitting reply to our
Prime Minister's speech at the UN.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.840
Sir, I doubt whether this
shelling is for distracting us.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.720
In case if they were
planning another attack...

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.560
then our intelligence agency
must have got some kind of news.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.480
India is in no position
to think about another attack.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.960
They are already in a difficult
position with the issue of Kashmir.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.080
This drama will continue
a little longer at the LOC.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.960
Our actors and singers
will be banned.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.640
Trade will get affected.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.400
But soon everything will cool down.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.080
But, we should not make the mistake
of underestimating our enemy.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.480
Zubair.
- Yes.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.680
Afzal.
- Sir.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.400
I should be getting
updates every minute.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.120
Send all the ammunition
you can at the LOC.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.400
We must give a
fitting reply as well.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.720
Is that understood?

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.040
Yes, sir.
- Good.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.240
What happened at the meeting today?

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.360
You're playing awkward shots today.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.840
There was a strong debate over LOC.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.320
The Indians have made our lives
difficult with their constant shelling.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.960
Some important decisions
were taken today in the meeting.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.760
Forget that.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.000
Watch this shot.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.960
Watch this.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.760
No Zameer,

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.000
your head's not in the game today.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.400
You know what, come home.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.320
I'll tell Aasma to make your favourite
dish and your favourite dessert.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.440
No. Not today.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.400
I'll have to stay awake
all night with the Minister sir.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.680
And tomorrow we might have
to go on a rendezvous of the LOC.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.560
Maybe some other day.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.480
What are you plans for 28th?

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.560
28... Yes, 28th is great.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.240
Sure.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.520
Come let's look for the ball now.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.000
Can you get me a closer shot?
- Yeah, sure.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.880
Slightly to the right.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.040
Good job, Ishaan. Good job.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.200
Hey...

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.600
sit down.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.360
Get it out now, Ishaan.
- I am trying.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.360
Ishaan, come on. Come on, Ishaan.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.520
Come on.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.280
A toy.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.960
Yes... yes...

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.360
Try.. come on, Ishaan.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.680
Sir this is the B-2 launchpad

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.800
where the terrorist responsible
for the Uri attack came from.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:15.440
A double storied building with 38 highly
trained terrorist and 5 exit points.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.000
Has our intelligence
confirmed these details?

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.040
Yes, sir.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.400
I've personally checked
every launchpad.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.680
What is the plan to attack?

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.040
Sir, our 80 commandos
are fully prepared.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.720
On the night of 28th, when
our shelling will be at its peak...

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:37.680
we'll enter POK in four
low flying MI-17 helicopters.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.560
And we'll start our
attack at exactly 2 am.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.280
These 80 commandos will be
divided into four teams of 20 each.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.320
Every team will have
to destroy two targets.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:49.080
Team Alpha, Along with
Major Vihaan, will first destroy B-1

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.600
and theJabbar and Idris' B-2 launchpad.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.320
Similarly teams Bravo,
Charlie, Delta,

01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.200
will destroy their targets
in Lipa, Bimber, and Kel.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.520
On the positive side, all these
targets are quite close to the LC...

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.760
which means from landing
to take off, the entire mission...

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.120
should last only for 50 minutes.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.000
Which means by 3 am

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.720
we should be back in our choppers.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.200
And by 5 am...

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.760
we'll be at the Srinagar base.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.120
There will be no
meetings here today.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.800
As you've all been told earlier,
we'll spend a normal day tomorrow...

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.400
with the press and public.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.640
On the 28th late night, there should
be no one here from the Ministry.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.840
Other than the Army
Intelligence, only

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.560
Arjun and Govind will
be allowed to stay here.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.800
Vihaan, when are
you leaving for Kashmir?

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.840
Sir, we leave tomorrow
from the Northern Command.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.880
Vihaan, I've heard that you've promised

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.240
to bring all your soldiers back safe
and sound.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.560
Sir, with your permission.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.680
My commandos &amp; I would like to have
dinner with you on the 30th night.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.640
Jai Hind.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.560
Jai Hind, sir.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.640
Capt. Ved.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.600
Akram.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.520
Bali.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.440
You three will lead the Bravo, Charlie,

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.320
and Delta, teams.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.120
As soon as we para-drop in POK,

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.720
we'll be easy targets.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.280
So we must carefully, and stealthily,

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.600
make it to our launchpads.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.840
Once we reach, again...

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.880
Outer parameters, Snipers.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.800
Inner parameters, Assaulters.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.840
Every team will be
carrying a signal jammer...

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.760
so that they cannot use radio-signals

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:51.240
or mobile phones to call for help...
during the attack.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.760
Remember boys,
our return is the toughest part.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.320
Our backs will be facing the enemy,

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.560
and they will be firing at us.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.120
So we have to be quick.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.800
Any questions?
- No, sir.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.480
I've promised that you will all return
with me to India safe and sound.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.920
And I bloody well intend
to keep my promise.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.840
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.800
Our assets in Muzaffarabad
and Gilgit have sent updates.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.160
It says that India is going to escalate
their shelling at the maximum today.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280
Excuse me.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.720
Sir.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.600
Commandos.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.160
The time has come

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.840
to make them bleed for their deeds.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.360
They want Kashmir
and we want their heads.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.600
Are you ready, boys?
- Yes, sir.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.040
How is the spirit?
- High, sir.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.560
How is the spirit?
- High, sir.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.000
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:05.880
Go. Go. Go.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.280
All the best...
- All the best...

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.880
All the best... Go. Go.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.640
It was really dark.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.720
I was really doing her hard.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.440
Little did I know
that she was a virgin.

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.240
Aasma.
- Yes.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.760
Get some ice for Zameer.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.680
Here. - Aasma, you've kept yourself busy
in the kitchen...

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.280
while we're getting
bored out here.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.840
Come and join us.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.960
I can't do two jobs at once especially
when I am cooking this exquisite dish.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.560
I'll join you in a while.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.160
You're looking much better today.

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.560
You've been really worried
for the past couple of days.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.160
What can I say?

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:11.640
These Indians have
made my life hell.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.440
I wonder what else they are
planning along with the shelling.

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.600
But our spies are
no less than them.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.680
We've taken all the precautions.

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.240
Did you taste these dates?

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.400
Thank God, food is ready.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:08.520
Now make me a large peg,
with lots of ice. - Of course.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.760
So Zameer,
how is your better half?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.120
She's in Birmingham.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.120
For the graduation ceremony
of my youngest daughter.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.640
I was supposed to go as well.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.120
But all thanks to the issues on the
LOC,

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.520
which spoiled all my plans.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.480
There's nothing we can do.

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.920
Well...

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.440
Cheers.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:44.640
Aasma, since when
did you start drinking whiskey?

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:47.600
What?

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.400
You normally drink wine, don't you?

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:59.840
So I thought let's give
whiskey a shot instead.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.680
There's something unique about...

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.240
women who drink whiskey.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.680
Wow!

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.120
Let's go.
- We are taking off.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.160
Salim, Raisina Hills.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.840
Zameer?

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.240
Zameer?

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.240
Zameer?

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.520
Zameer?

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.560
Zameer? Zameer?

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:18.120
What was the decision taken
against India in today's meeting?

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.560
Were the words "Surgical Strike"
used in the meeting today?

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.240
Were the words "Surgical Strike"
used in the meeting today?

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.440
Zameer?

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.440
Dear, what are you doing?
- Zameer,

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.920
what was the decision
taken in the meeting today?

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:37.800
Zameer?

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.520
What did the Minister say?

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.440
Zameer?

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.560
Radar... AEWAC... radar.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.480
We've received some
Intel from our spies.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.200
They have spotted helicopters near
the LOC painted in Pakistani colours.

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.320
Their helicopters were repainted.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:57.160
Maybe they are planning to fly low from
the LOC and attack our forward posts.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.000
Is there any way we can stop them?

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.840
We should launch the AEWAC
radar near the Uri sector.

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.720
If the enemy helicopter comes anywhere
within 20 meters of the LOC...

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.880
then our anti-aircraft missiles
will shoot it down immediately.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.760
Hello.
- Alpha Team needs to abort the mission.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.600
I repeat, the Alpha
team must abort the mission.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.640
What?

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:39.920
Sir.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.080
We've detected air
activity at the LC.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.880
Keep the anti-aircraft
missiles ready.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.440
Sir.
- Pallavi,

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.720
has Vihaan's chopper taken off?
- Yes, sir.

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.560
They will cross LC in 10 seconds.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.720
Connect me to Vihaan now.

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.760
Vihaan, I've patched
you with Govind sir.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.400
Sir, Vihaan is online.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.720
Vihaan, don't cross the LC.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.800
I repeat, do not cross the LC.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.160
Turn your choppers around.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.520
Turn around! Turn around!

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.080
They have launched the
AEWAC radar in Muzaffarabad sector.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.680
That means Alpha
team cannot cross by air.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.360
We'll have to abort your mission.

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.920
Pallavi, listen.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.080
During Farooq's
interrogation he said that...

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.040
he used to bring terrorists
to India through the caves...

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.880
which our army
is keeping an eye on.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.720
Get me the exact
coordinates to those caves.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.440
If we can't go through the air,
then we'll go by land.

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.120
But we will complete this
mission today at any cost.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.840
Bravo, Charlie, Delta,

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.280
you
three will move ahead as planned.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.640
There will be radio silence
amongst all the teams now.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.400
We'll only be in touch with
the army intelligence directly.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.480
They will keep me posted.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.120
Correct! Bravo, Charlie, Delta...

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.040
Your areas are safe
according to Intelligence.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.520
Move ahead as planned.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:28.840
Sir.
- What's the status?

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.240
Sir, we are still figuring out
the coordinates.

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.840
Thank you.
- Welcome sir.

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:58.680
Let's go.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:03.360
Sir, entering a cave blindly without a
recce and monitoring is way to risky.

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:13.400
There might be Rangers or Terrorists
posted for guarding these caves.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.560
Vihaan, wait.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.720
Is Ishaan online? Can he hear us?

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:37.640
Yes, sir. He can.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.120
Ishaan.
- Sir.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.280
Can you see the GPS location
of all the four teams?

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:43.840
Yes, sir. I can see it.
- Good.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.400
From now on you're
going to be their eyes.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.560
Tell the operators
that all the four Garudas...

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.840
will stay a few meters
ahead of the team leaders.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.120
And you keep tracking
their position through GPS.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.040
As soon as you sense any danger,
you must inform the team leader.

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.280
Sure, sir.

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.160
Sir!

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:06.280
Sir, we're in Pakistan
Occupied Kashmir.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.320
Good job, Vihaan.

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.600
The other teams are
soon reaching their targets.

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.480
Bilal? Dawood?

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.400
Say hello to your brothers in hell.

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.040
And ask them to hold on
to the celebrations.

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.240
We plan to send them
a lot more guests tonight.

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.520
Sir, the first
operation was a success.

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.080
We've destroyed the B-1 launchpad.

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.760
What is the status
of the remaining teams?

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.560
Teams Bravo and Charlie have
attacked their secondary location.

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.360
Team Delta is preparing to return
after completing their mission.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.480
Not a single casualty.
- Good.

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.840
Let's go.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.080
Abdullah!
- Yes.

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.160
Come here.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.760
Take Zameer sir home. He's had
a little too much to drink today.

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.680
Yes.

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.880
Come on... Go out quickly.

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.000
Where is Idris?

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.600
Where is Idris?

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.520
Where is Idris?

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:52.400
Camera!

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:53.840
Camera!

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.160
Camera!

01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:04.960
Did you find Idris?

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.560
No, sir.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.000
I don't think he's here.

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:10.920
He's here.

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:35.680
Sir, someone has informed the Police.
They are just two minutes away.

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.720
Vihaan, hurry up.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.240
Copy, sir.

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:44.040
But Idris has to die.
- But, Vihaan.

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.680
Sartaj, move.

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:40.920
You barged into my home
and killed my brothers.

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:43.800
Today I barged into your
home and I'm killing your brothers.

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:46.280
We are the Indian Army.

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:49.240
Indian Army!

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.560
Ishaan, where to?

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:21.800
Sir, lower east side. Out
the small door and into the fields.

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.520
Who's there? I'll shoot.

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:53.640
Sartaj.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.440
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.880
Boys go faster. Faster. Faster.

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:47.240
Sir, be ready. We're getting
a Pakistani chopper along with us.

02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:19.240
Vihaan, we're sending
jets to give you cover fire.

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:20.880
They will be at your
location in 10 minutes.

02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:22.000
Copy, sir.

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:42.960
Sir, we're running
out of ammunition.

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:44.880
