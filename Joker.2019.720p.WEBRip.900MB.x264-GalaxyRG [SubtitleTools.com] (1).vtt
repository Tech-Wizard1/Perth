00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.541
The news never ends.

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:11.411
This is 1080 GCR.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.847
You get all the news you
need, all day long.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.317
Good morning.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.618
It's 42 degrees at 10:30 on this
Thursday, October 15th.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.188
I'm Stan L.
Brooks, and here's what's happening.

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.491
It's day 18
of the garbage strike,

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:27.327
with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.561
Even the nicest sections
of the city

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.031
are looking like slums.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.798
Health Commissioner
Edward O'Rourke is

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.700
declaring a city-wide
state of emergency

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.635
for the first time in decades.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:38.737
There's no need
to wait until somebody dies

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.539
or comes down
with typhoid fever.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.475
It's already
a serious situation.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.909
It's
something that affects

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.378
almost everyone
in the city,

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.147
no matter who they are
or where they live.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.382
You can't go
down no one avenue

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.717
without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.119
It's starting to
affect my business

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.586
when customers
can't get in here

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.289
because of
the garbage situation.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.058
I'm not out
that long to smell it,

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.925
but I think to look at
it, it's terrible.

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:01.560
It don't
affect me except

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:03.396
for the very bad
smell here.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.531
It's horrific.

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:06.032
It's a mess.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.699
I've been in this country
for 50 years,

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.002
and I've never seen
anything like it.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.470
What is this world
coming to?

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.272
Put 'em
in a room,

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.939
let 'em sit there and talk
until they get it over with.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.774
24 hours, 48 hours,
how long it takes.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.876
The idea of the
National Guard moving in

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:19.578
and cleaning up
is a good idea.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.114
In other news,

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.648
the building industry
and landlords today

00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:24.017
expressed concern
over the latest

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.918
increase in
heating oil prices.

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:27.253
Renters in the metro area

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.122
are certain to
feel the pinch...

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.425
Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.093
Nice outfit, pal.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.561
If you're gonna be a
clown, at least you could be

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:10.230
a good one.
You know that, right?

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.763
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.099
Go, go, go!

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.534
Hey!

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.069
He's coming!

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.204
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.073
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.574
Stop them!

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.076
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.347
Where's
your sign, clown?

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.747
Hey!

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.686
Go, clown!
Come on!

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:35.888
Stop them!

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.259
Go! Come on!

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.861
Stop them!

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.830
Come on, run!

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.234
Hey!

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.869
You fucking...

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.577
Oh, shit! Good hit.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.312
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.447
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.516
Harder! Harder!

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:04.850
Beat him up.
Take his stuff.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.753
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.310
Ha!

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.859
Is it just me,

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:56.529
or is it getting
crazier out there?

00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:03.436
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.238
People are upset.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.474
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.841
These are tough times.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.380
How about you?

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.151
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.587
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.191
Great.

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.093
Did you bring it
with you?

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:32.998
Arthur.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.034
Last time,
I asked you to bring your journal

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.537
with you
for these appointments.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.072
Can I see it?

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.952
I've been using it as a journal,

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:58.224
but also
as a joke diary.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:01.993
Funny thoughts
or observations.

00:06:02.894 --> 00:06:04.330
I think
I told you

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.433
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.472
No, you didn't.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.042
I think I did.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:28.421
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.773
How does it feel to
have to come here?

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.042
Does it help to have
someone to talk to?

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.114
I think
I felt better

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.350
when I was locked
up in the hospital.

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.586
And have you
thought more about

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.790
why you were
locked up?

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.996
Who knows?

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.739
I was wondering if you
could ask the doctor

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.940
to increase
my medication.

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:31.217
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.153
Surely,
they must be doing something.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.725
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.130
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.068
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.503
Just stop.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.779
What?
You think that's funny?

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.723
I'm sorry. I have a...

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.707
I'm sorry.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:41.707
Happy,
did you check the mail

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.110
before you came up?

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:44.844
Yeah, Mom.

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:47.413
Nothing.

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:51.951
And finally, tonight,

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:54.520
just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse...

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:55.988
...authorities are saying

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.125
the city is under siege
by scores of rats.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.525
And not just any rats,

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.661
but super rats,
who are hard to kill.

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:03.929
He must not be
getting my letters.

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.098
Yeah.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.266
It's Thomas Wayne,
Mom.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.734
He's a busy man.

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:12.872
Please. I worked for
that family for years.

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:15.341
The least he could do
is write back.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:19.979
Here. Don't get all worked up.
Eat.

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.347
You need to eat.

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:25.018
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:28.421
Both victims
were taken to Gotham General.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:29.889
Sounds like

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.624
the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.492
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:37.496
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.932
Well, everybody
on the news.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.401
He's the only one who
could save the city.

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:43.936
He owes it to us.

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:48.340
Come sit. It's starting.

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:50.876
Yay, Murray.

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:54.547
From NCB
Studios in Gotham City,

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:58.784
it's Live with
Murray Franklin!

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:02.189
Tonight, Murray welcomes
Sandra Winger...

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:03.823
Oh, Sandra Winger's on.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.726
...and the piano stylings
of Yeldon and Chantel.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.894
Joining Murray,
as always,

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.764
Ellis Drane
and his jazz orchestra.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.834
And now,
without further ado,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.536
Murray Franklin.

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:31.817
Thank you.

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.187
Thank you.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.956
We got a great-looking
audience tonight.

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:38.958
Yeah!

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:41.061
Wow. Thank you.
Thank you.

00:12:41.128 --> 00:12:42.695
Thank you.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.065
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:47.666
- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:51.303
Well, today,
the mayor said he has a solution.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.073
You ready for this?

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.440
Super cats.

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:00.279
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:01.981
I love you,
Murray!

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.085
I love you, too.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.754
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:09.955
Who is that?

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:12.159
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:14.227
Stand up for me.

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.494
Go ahead.

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:22.568
What's your name?

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.703
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.572
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.374
Oh, okay. Well,
there's something special about you,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.542
Arthur, I could tell.

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:30.676
Where are you from?

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.578
I live right here
in the city

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.513
with my mother.

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:36.882
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.717
There's nothing funny
about that.

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.820
I lived with my mother before I made it.
Just me and her.

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.789
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.058
and he never
came back.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.392
Aww.

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.094
I know
what that's like, Murray.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.863
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.932
I take good care
of my mother.

00:13:56.869 --> 00:14:00.073
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.807
She does.

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:05.778
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.547
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.382
Aww.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.686
Wow.

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:18.958
I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.961
Come on.
For that, you gotta come down.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.562
Come on! Come on.

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:32.738
Come on.

00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:50.190
Okay, we got a big show tonight.
Stay tuned.

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:52.625
We'll be right back.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.194
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.229
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:57.529
It made my day.

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.032
Thanks, Murray.

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:00.833
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.401
the audience,
all that stuff?

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:03.602
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.005
to have a kid
like you.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.448
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.318
Another day
in chuckle town.

00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:52.584
Yup.

00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:57.090
You okay?

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:01.660
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:04.496
Fucking savages.

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:07.300
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:08.934
No.

00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:10.869
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.771
All the crazy shit
out there.

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:14.807
They're animals.

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:20.646
You know what?

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:26.852
Here.

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:30.090
What is it?

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.224
Take it.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.226
It's for you.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.100
You gotta
protect yourself out there.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.967
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.803
Randall,

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.874
I'm not supposed to
have a gun.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.445
Don't sweat it, Art.

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.879
No one
has to know.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:56.383
And you can pay me
back some other time.

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:57.816
You know
you're my boy.

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.254
Arthur,

00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:03.423
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.359
Hey, Gary.
You know what I've always wondered?

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:07.659
No idea.

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:09.528
Do you people call it
miniature golf

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.864
or is it just golf
to you?

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:17.970
Punch him in the
dick, Gary.

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.523
Hello, Hoyt.

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:39.059
Gary said you wanted to see me.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:42.262
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:43.562
Not quite.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.664
Just been working
on my material.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.733
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.469
Look,
I like you, Arthur.

00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:50.869
You know,
a lot of the guys,

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:52.305
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.774
I don't even know
why I like you.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.011
But I got
another complaint.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.979
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:02.981
The guy said
you disappeared.

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:04.750
Never even
returned his sign.

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.520
Because I got jumped.

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.422
Didn't you hear?

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.157
For a sign?

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:13.625
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:15.528
Just get him
his sign back.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:18.364
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.133
Why would
I keep his sign?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.203
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.306
If you don't
return the sign,

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:28.807
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:30.976
Are we clear?

00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:35.081
Listen,
I'm trying to help you.

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:37.383
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.884
The other guys,

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.719
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.788
because people
think you're weird.

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:45.724
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:36.509
Wait,
wait, wait.

00:19:36.576 --> 00:19:37.776
Wait.

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:42.081
Thank you.

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:06.772
This building is so
awful, isn't it?

00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:10.909
This building is so
awful, right, Mommy?

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.580
Yes, we can
hear you, GiGi.

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:16.549
It's so awful,
Mommy.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:18.884
Right, Mommy?

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:28.127
- Good night.
- This building's

00:20:28.194 --> 00:20:29.329
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.135
Hey.

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:43.909
Come on.

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:04.330
- Look up.
- Mmm.

00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:06.466
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:10.303
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.803
What do you think
he's gonna do?

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.007
He's gonna help us.

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:18.478
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:20.313
Why would
he help us?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.882
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.486
If he knew
how we were living,

00:21:26.552 --> 00:21:31.357
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:34.360
I can't explain it to
you any better than that.

00:21:36.062 --> 00:21:38.164
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:40.832
Or me.

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:42.168
Everybody's telling me

00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:45.705
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:48.974
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:51.678
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:54.380
Don't you have to be
funny to be a comedian?

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:59.312
Hey, what's your name?

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.215
Arthur.

00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:05.884
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:08.054
I know.

00:23:08.121 --> 00:23:10.390
You know who's not?
Him.

00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:17.896
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:19.465
Mom, what?

00:23:19.532 --> 00:23:21.300
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:23.836
I'm watching
an old war movie!

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.438
Turn it down!

00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:27.106
Um...

00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:33.713
Sorry, Mom.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:47.427
You good?

00:24:54.527 --> 00:24:58.064
It's nice to see these
couples out at my show.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.299
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:03.202
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:04.937
My favorite one
right now is

00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:07.974
professor and senior
who really needs

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.308
to pass my class
to graduate.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.044
Yes.

00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:14.780
So, I'll tell you
how I operate.

00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:16.082
I'm a professor at

00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:17.583
a prestigious
New England university...

00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:22.955
...and my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."

00:25:24.991 --> 00:25:26.726
I know. I know.

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:30.429
Why is she a senior in the intro?
I didn't buy it either.

00:25:30.496 --> 00:25:32.565
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:35.301
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:37.537
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis."

00:25:37.603 --> 00:25:39.805
I can't use my real last
name at this college

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.307
'cause they
don't hire Jews.

00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:44.377
It's something I'll address

00:25:44.443 --> 00:25:46.646
once I have tenure,
but for now...

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.481
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis,

00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:49.882
I think I might be
in danger of failing

00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:51.183
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.418
and I just want
you to know

00:25:52.485 --> 00:25:54.787
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

00:25:54.854 --> 00:25:59.191
And I said,
"Anything?" And she said...

00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:08.160
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:09.862
Were you following
me today?

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:15.301
Yeah.

00:27:17.004 --> 00:27:19.472
I thought
that was you.

00:27:19.538 --> 00:27:22.274
I was hoping you'd come
in and rob the place.

00:27:24.111 --> 00:27:25.611
I have a gun.

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:27.580
I could come
by tomorrow.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.518
You're so funny, Arthur.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.023
Yeah.

00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:38.557
You know,
I do stand-up comedy.

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:41.627
You should maybe come
see a show sometime.

00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:43.729
I could do that.

00:27:43.796 --> 00:27:44.797
Yeah?

00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:46.932
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:48.200
Yeah.

00:28:44.757 --> 00:28:48.527
Hoyt, please,
I love this job.

00:28:48.594 --> 00:28:50.763
Arthur, I need
to know why

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.998
you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.

00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:56.302
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:58.304
That's bullshit.
Bullshit.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.141
What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?

00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:02.575
Besides,
Randall told me

00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:05.845
you tried to buy a .38
off him last week.

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:07.246
Randall told you that?

00:29:07.313 --> 00:29:10.249
You're a fuck-up,
Arthur, and a liar.

00:29:10.316 --> 00:29:11.517
You're fired!

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.644
Jefferson Street.

00:29:38.711 --> 00:29:40.513
Next stop, Ninth Ave.

00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:44.617
I'm telling you,
she wanted my number.

00:29:44.683 --> 00:29:46.452
We should've just stayed.

00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:48.521
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:51.224
Are you nuts?
Did you see how close we were dancing?

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.558
She was in love.

00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:54.161
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.

00:29:54.227 --> 00:29:56.662
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.

00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:00.966
Hey,
you want some French fries?

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:05.437
Hello?

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:07.673
Talking to you.
Hey.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.575
No, thank you.

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:13.746
You sure?

00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:16.749
They're real good.

00:30:19.418 --> 00:30:22.421
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.

00:30:23.422 --> 00:30:24.523
Whoo...

00:30:49.216 --> 00:30:50.916
Is something funny,
asshole?

00:30:55.088 --> 00:30:56.589
Bitch!

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:56.448
So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?

00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:58.417
Nothing.

00:32:02.255 --> 00:32:03.989
I have...
I have a condition.

00:32:04.057 --> 00:32:06.226
I'll tell you what you
have, you asshole.

00:32:06.293 --> 00:32:07.593
Whoa!

00:32:09.762 --> 00:32:12.032
Please, stop!

00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:14.167
We got
a kicker, huh?

00:32:14.234 --> 00:32:16.468
Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.

00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:20.606
Stay down, freak!

00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:40.926
Hey!

00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:04.483
Ninth Avenue.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.851
Next stop,
Hunter's Point.

00:33:05.918 --> 00:33:07.187
Hey!

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:15.095
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:54.733
Shit. Shit.

00:36:48.074 --> 00:36:50.109
I read it was
a guy in full makeup.

00:36:50.176 --> 00:36:52.612
No,
it says right here it was a mask.

00:36:52.679 --> 00:36:55.048
Either way,
I think it's good for business.

00:36:55.114 --> 00:36:57.650
They got clowns on the
front of every newspaper.

00:36:57.716 --> 00:36:59.152
Big man,
what's the good word?

00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:00.353
Hey.

00:37:03.156 --> 00:37:05.558
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:06.925
Sorry, mate.

00:37:06.992 --> 00:37:08.661
Yeah.

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:09.995
It doesn't seem fair,

00:37:10.063 --> 00:37:12.165
getting fired like that.

00:37:13.132 --> 00:37:14.434
Did you really
bring a gun

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.802
to the children's
hospital, Artie?

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:18.304
What the fuck would
you do that for?

00:37:18.371 --> 00:37:19.871
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?

00:37:19.938 --> 00:37:21.074
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.408
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

00:37:23.842 --> 00:37:25.278
Why don't you ask
Randall about it?

00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:27.480
It was his gun.

00:37:27.547 --> 00:37:29.349
- What?
- I still owe you for that,

00:37:29.415 --> 00:37:30.450
don't I?

00:37:30.516 --> 00:37:32.751
What the fuck
are you talking about?

00:37:32.818 --> 00:37:34.654
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.

00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:41.261
Oh, no!

00:37:42.861 --> 00:37:44.830
I forgot
to punch out.

00:38:14.694 --> 00:38:16.962
And as our city
tries to make sense

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.866
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week,

00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:22.402
we're joined
by Thomas Wayne.

00:38:22.468 --> 00:38:24.936
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.

00:38:25.004 --> 00:38:26.406
Yes, Mother.

00:38:26.472 --> 00:38:27.906
Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.

00:38:27.973 --> 00:38:29.108
They're asking him about

00:38:29.175 --> 00:38:30.743
those horrible
subway murders.

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.111
Thank you, Thomas.
I know

00:38:32.178 --> 00:38:34.147
this is a difficult time
for you.

00:38:34.213 --> 00:38:35.814
Why him?

00:38:35.881 --> 00:38:37.650
Looks like
he's gained weight.

00:38:37.717 --> 00:38:40.186
Yes,
all three worked for Wayne Investments.

00:38:40.253 --> 00:38:42.055
Good, decent, educated.

00:38:42.121 --> 00:38:45.024
Although I didn't know
any of them personally.

00:38:46.592 --> 00:38:47.926
Like all Wayne employees,

00:38:47.993 --> 00:38:50.296
past and present,
they're family.

00:38:50.363 --> 00:38:52.165
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

00:38:52.231 --> 00:38:53.932
There now seems to be

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:55.934
a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.

00:38:56.002 --> 00:38:58.237
It's almost as if our
less fortunate residents

00:38:58.304 --> 00:39:00.540
are taking the side
of the killer.

00:39:00.606 --> 00:39:02.408
Yes,
and it's a shame.

00:39:02.475 --> 00:39:03.909
It's one
of the reasons why

00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:05.345
I'm considering
a run for mayor.

00:39:06.045 --> 00:39:08.281
Gotham's lost its way.

00:39:08.348 --> 00:39:10.149
What about
the eyewitness report

00:39:10.216 --> 00:39:12.851
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?

00:39:12.918 --> 00:39:15.021
Well,
it makes total sense to me.

00:39:15.088 --> 00:39:17.523
What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.026
Someone who hides
behind a mask.

00:39:20.093 --> 00:39:21.461
Someone who is envious

00:39:21.527 --> 00:39:25.565
of those more fortunate
than themselves,

00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:28.534
yet they're too scared
to show their own face.

00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:31.604
And until those kind of
people change for the better,

00:39:31.671 --> 00:39:35.408
those of us who have made
something of our lives

00:39:35.475 --> 00:39:38.010
will always look
at those who haven't

00:39:38.077 --> 00:39:40.680
as nothing but clowns.

00:39:42.582 --> 00:39:44.517
Thomas Wayne,
thank you for coming in this morning.

00:39:44.584 --> 00:39:45.585
It's not funny.

00:40:07.173 --> 00:40:09.575
I heard this song on
the radio the other day,

00:40:12.044 --> 00:40:16.449
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:18.718
Arthur...

00:40:18.785 --> 00:40:20.119
Which is crazy,

00:40:22.221 --> 00:40:26.259
because that's
my clown name at work.

00:40:26.325 --> 00:40:29.095
And until
a little while ago,

00:40:30.096 --> 00:40:32.698
it was like
nobody ever saw me.

00:40:34.534 --> 00:40:37.303
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.072
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

00:40:43.142 --> 00:40:44.677
You don't listen,
do you?

00:40:46.212 --> 00:40:51.217
I don't think you
ever really hear me.

00:40:51.284 --> 00:40:53.985
You just ask the same
questions every week.

00:40:54.053 --> 00:40:58.458
"How's your job?
Are you having any negative thoughts?"

00:40:58.524 --> 00:41:02.361
All I have are
negative thoughts,

00:41:02.428 --> 00:41:05.364
but you don't
listen anyway.

00:41:05.431 --> 00:41:09.001
I said,
for my whole life,

00:41:09.068 --> 00:41:12.438
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

00:41:13.606 --> 00:41:15.374
But I do.

00:41:16.542 --> 00:41:20.680
And people are
starting to notice.

00:41:22.281 --> 00:41:24.150
They've cut our funding.

00:41:24.217 --> 00:41:26.152
We're closing down
our offices next week.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.455
The city has cut funding
across the board.

00:41:29.522 --> 00:41:31.557
Social Services is
part of that.

00:41:31.624 --> 00:41:34.060
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

00:41:34.827 --> 00:41:36.162
Okay.

00:41:39.932 --> 00:41:42.335
They don't give a shit about
people like you, Arthur.

00:41:44.337 --> 00:41:45.872
And they really
don't give a shit

00:41:45.938 --> 00:41:48.107
about people
like me, either.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.578
Fuck.

00:42:00.553 --> 00:42:03.356
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

00:42:06.158 --> 00:42:08.027
Who do I talk to?

00:42:10.196 --> 00:42:12.231
I'm sorry, Arthur.

00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:18.771
I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.

00:42:18.838 --> 00:42:21.641
You know, like,
"Can I see myself in this long-term?"

00:42:21.707 --> 00:42:23.776
"Is it safe?"

00:42:23.843 --> 00:42:25.278
"Is it reliable?"

00:42:25.344 --> 00:42:27.547
"Could it kill me?"

00:42:27.613 --> 00:42:29.715
Most guys,
we look at sex like parking a car.

00:42:29.782 --> 00:42:32.351
We're like,
"There's a spot."

00:42:32.418 --> 00:42:33.753
"There's another spot.

00:42:33.819 --> 00:42:35.321
That would work."

00:42:35.388 --> 00:42:37.590
"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."

00:42:38.958 --> 00:42:41.928
"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."

00:42:44.297 --> 00:42:46.866
All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.

00:42:51.804 --> 00:42:55.308
One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.

00:42:55.374 --> 00:42:57.209
All right, now,
this next comic describes

00:42:57.276 --> 00:42:59.445
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

00:42:59.512 --> 00:43:02.015
who from a young age
was always told

00:43:02.081 --> 00:43:03.816
that his purpose in life

00:43:03.883 --> 00:43:07.653
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.388
Um... Okay.

00:43:09.455 --> 00:43:11.724
Please help me welcome Arthur
Fleck, y'all.

00:43:11.791 --> 00:43:12.858
Arthur Fleck.

00:43:36.882 --> 00:43:39.719
Hello, it's good to be here.

00:44:04.343 --> 00:44:07.313
I hated school
when I was a kid.

00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:27.767
I hated school as a kid.

00:44:29.002 --> 00:44:30.603
My mother
would say,

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.338
"You should enjoy it.

00:44:32.405 --> 00:44:34.573
One day,
you'll have to work for a living."

00:44:35.741 --> 00:44:37.144
"No, I won't, Ma,

00:44:37.209 --> 00:44:38.978
I'm gonna
be a comedian."

00:44:48.155 --> 00:44:49.488
Um...

00:44:51.657 --> 00:44:53.826
Here's one.

00:44:53.893 --> 00:44:56.829
You know,
I was just thinking the other day,

00:44:56.896 --> 00:44:59.265
why are the rich people...

00:45:39.472 --> 00:45:40.940
You believe that shit?

00:45:42.808 --> 00:45:43.809
Fuck 'em.

00:45:45.644 --> 00:45:48.547
I think the guy that
did it is a hero.

00:45:50.483 --> 00:45:52.651
Three less pricks
in Gotham City,

00:45:52.718 --> 00:45:54.987
only a million
more to go.

00:46:26.552 --> 00:46:28.054
And,
buddy, as always,

00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:29.355
thanks for the laughs.

00:46:29.421 --> 00:46:30.823
I'm sure
we'll see you again.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.259
You know
we'll be here, right?

00:46:32.324 --> 00:46:34.060
I hope.

00:46:34.127 --> 00:46:37.429
Tomorrow night, we have Diana
Hudson, Greg Gordon,

00:46:37.496 --> 00:46:41.001
and animal expert,
Hugh Little.

00:46:41.067 --> 00:46:42.368
Thanks for watching.

00:46:42.434 --> 00:46:44.737
Good night,
and always remember,

00:46:44.804 --> 00:46:46.338
that's life.

00:46:50.576 --> 00:46:51.911
That's life.

00:46:56.582 --> 00:47:00.086
Momma,
time to wake up and go to bed.

00:47:00.153 --> 00:47:01.453
Hmm? Oh...

00:47:03.455 --> 00:47:05.025
Oh, Happy.

00:47:07.693 --> 00:47:09.495
Happy, I wrote
a new letter.

00:47:09.562 --> 00:47:12.065
Come on,
dance with me.

00:47:12.132 --> 00:47:14.834
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

00:47:23.576 --> 00:47:25.411
You smell like cologne.

00:47:25.477 --> 00:47:28.114
It's 'cause I just
had a big date.

00:47:28.181 --> 00:47:30.016
Oh.

00:47:32.585 --> 00:47:34.587
Just don't forget
to mail it.

00:48:00.046 --> 00:48:01.780
The Murray
Franklin Show is taped live

00:48:01.847 --> 00:48:03.415
before a studio audience

00:48:03.482 --> 00:48:05.784
in beautiful downtown
Gotham City.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.616
You're gonna kill me.
You're gonna give me a heart attack!

00:49:10.683 --> 00:49:11.917
Don't give me your...

00:49:11.984 --> 00:49:13.886
No. No.

00:49:13.953 --> 00:49:17.190
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

00:49:17.257 --> 00:49:18.457
Okay.

00:49:18.524 --> 00:49:19.792
Okay.

00:49:24.364 --> 00:49:26.532
I'm not angry, Mom.

00:49:26.598 --> 00:49:29.135
I'm not angry.

00:49:29.202 --> 00:49:30.569
Please.

00:49:31.404 --> 00:49:34.207
Mom, is this real?

00:49:37.743 --> 00:49:40.980
He's an extraordinary
man, Happy.

00:49:41.047 --> 00:49:43.716
He's a very
powerful man.

00:49:45.151 --> 00:49:47.753
We were in love.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.755
He said it was best
that we not be together

00:49:49.822 --> 00:49:52.125
because of appearances.

00:49:54.493 --> 00:49:57.997
And I could never
tell anyone because...

00:50:00.433 --> 00:50:02.002
Well, I signed
some papers.

00:50:03.669 --> 00:50:05.171
And besides,
you can imagine

00:50:05.238 --> 00:50:08.941
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:13.013
What they'd say
about you.

00:50:16.982 --> 00:50:19.152
What would
they say, Mom?

00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:09.262
Hmm.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.241
Hmm.

00:52:52.338 --> 00:52:53.373
Hi.

00:52:56.342 --> 00:52:57.843
What's your name?

00:52:58.844 --> 00:53:00.746
I'm Bruce.

00:53:01.614 --> 00:53:02.948
Bruce.

00:53:04.716 --> 00:53:06.119
I'm Arthur.

00:53:27.906 --> 00:53:29.409
That's better.

00:53:30.343 --> 00:53:32.011
Bruce! Bruce!

00:53:33.413 --> 00:53:34.614
Get away
from that man.

00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:36.848
It's okay.
I'm a good guy.

00:53:36.915 --> 00:53:38.750
What are you doing?
Who are you?

00:53:38.817 --> 00:53:40.420
I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne.

00:53:40.486 --> 00:53:43.289
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

00:53:44.424 --> 00:53:45.824
Why did you give him
these flowers?

00:53:45.891 --> 00:53:47.260
No,
they're not real.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:51.197
It's magic.

00:53:51.264 --> 00:53:52.864
I was just trying to
make him smile.

00:53:52.931 --> 00:53:55.734
Well, it's not funny,
is it?

00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:57.036
Do I need
to call the police?

00:53:57.103 --> 00:53:59.805
No. Please.

00:53:59.871 --> 00:54:03.109
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.

00:54:03.176 --> 00:54:04.611
She used to work here years ago.

00:54:04.677 --> 00:54:06.845
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

00:54:07.779 --> 00:54:09.415
You are her son.

00:54:09.482 --> 00:54:10.949
Yeah.

00:54:11.017 --> 00:54:12.985
Did you know her?

00:54:16.289 --> 00:54:19.359
I know
about the two of them.

00:54:19.425 --> 00:54:21.960
She told me everything.

00:54:23.463 --> 00:54:25.498
There's
nothing to know.

00:54:26.599 --> 00:54:29.135
There is no "them."

00:54:29.202 --> 00:54:32.205
Your mother
was delusional.

00:54:32.272 --> 00:54:33.606
She was
a sick woman.

00:54:33.673 --> 00:54:35.907
Don't say that.

00:54:36.842 --> 00:54:38.411
Just go.

00:54:38.478 --> 00:54:39.811
Mmm?

00:54:39.878 --> 00:54:41.980
Before you make a
fool of yourself.

00:54:43.316 --> 00:54:46.252
Thomas Wayne
is my father.

00:54:51.291 --> 00:54:52.558
He left me.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.396
Let go! Let go!

00:55:22.689 --> 00:55:24.424
Keep the respirations
above 15.

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:27.026
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

00:55:28.227 --> 00:55:29.395
Mom?

00:55:30.063 --> 00:55:31.164
What happened?

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.931
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

00:55:32.998 --> 00:55:34.500
- What happened?
- You can probably help us

00:55:34.567 --> 00:55:36.302
out inside.
We don't know what happened yet.

00:55:36.369 --> 00:55:38.004
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- Step.

00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:39.472
One more.
We got one more lift.

00:55:39.539 --> 00:55:40.673
I'm getting

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.973
a little resistance here,
Michael.

00:55:44.577 --> 00:55:45.578
Lift.

00:55:51.017 --> 00:55:52.719
I'm right here.

00:55:52.785 --> 00:55:54.087
Excuse me, sir.

00:55:54.153 --> 00:55:55.188
Does your mother take
any medications?

00:55:55.254 --> 00:55:56.322
- No.
- Excuse me,

00:55:56.389 --> 00:55:58.057
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

00:55:58.124 --> 00:55:59.359
Sir, when was the last
time you spoke to her?

00:55:59.425 --> 00:56:00.560
I don't know.

00:56:45.505 --> 00:56:47.707
Mr. Fleck.

00:56:47.774 --> 00:56:49.941
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

00:56:50.009 --> 00:56:52.512
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

00:56:52.578 --> 00:56:55.515
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

00:56:56.915 --> 00:56:58.518
so we spoke
with your mother.

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:01.320
Oh.

00:57:02.255 --> 00:57:03.856
What did you
say to her?

00:57:03.922 --> 00:57:04.990
Did you do this?

00:57:05.057 --> 00:57:06.559
What? No.

00:57:06.626 --> 00:57:08.828
No, no, no.
We just asked her some questions,

00:57:08.895 --> 00:57:10.563
and she got hysterical.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.298
Hyperventilating,

00:57:12.365 --> 00:57:13.733
collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.335
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

00:57:16.402 --> 00:57:18.905
We're sorry to
hear about that.

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.108
But, like I said,
I still have some questions for you.

00:57:22.175 --> 00:57:23.376
They're about
the subway killings

00:57:23.443 --> 00:57:24.911
that happened
last week.

00:57:24.976 --> 00:57:26.312
You've heard about them, right?

00:57:26.379 --> 00:57:27.513
Yeah.

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:28.648
It's horrible.

00:57:28.714 --> 00:57:30.583
Right.

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:34.020
So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.

00:57:34.086 --> 00:57:36.122
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

00:57:36.189 --> 00:57:37.956
into the children's hospital.

00:57:39.192 --> 00:57:41.227
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

00:57:41.294 --> 00:57:43.196
It's part
of my act.

00:57:43.262 --> 00:57:44.597
I'm a party clown.

00:57:44.664 --> 00:57:46.998
All right.
So, why were you fired?

00:57:50.036 --> 00:57:52.738
They said
I wasn't funny enough.

00:57:52.805 --> 00:57:54.640
Can you imagine that?

00:57:54.707 --> 00:57:58.644
If you don't mind,
I have to go take care of my mother.

00:57:58.711 --> 00:58:01.314
Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

00:58:03.282 --> 00:58:05.751
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

00:58:06.552 --> 00:58:07.887
is it real,

00:58:07.954 --> 00:58:10.189
or some sort
of clown thing?

00:58:10.256 --> 00:58:13.125
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

00:58:13.192 --> 00:58:15.628
I mean, is it part of your act?

00:58:18.097 --> 00:58:19.565
What do you think?

00:58:25.304 --> 00:58:26.572
It's exit only.

00:58:50.963 --> 00:58:53.165
She's gonna be okay.

00:58:57.336 --> 00:58:59.305
I'm gonna
get a coffee.

00:58:59.872 --> 00:59:00.940
You want one?

00:59:01.008 --> 00:59:02.208
Yeah.

00:59:14.921 --> 00:59:18.157
So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,

00:59:18.224 --> 00:59:21.394
you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.062
I told him,
"The garbage strike

00:59:23.129 --> 00:59:24.830
is still going on, Billy."

00:59:24.897 --> 00:59:26.732
And he says, and I'm not
kidding, Billy says,

00:59:26.799 --> 00:59:28.935
"So, where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?"

00:59:35.942 --> 00:59:38.511
And finally,
in a world where everyone

00:59:38.578 --> 00:59:40.246
thinks they could
do my job,

00:59:40.313 --> 00:59:42.348
we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,

00:59:42.415 --> 00:59:44.150
right here in Gotham.

00:59:44.216 --> 00:59:45.651
Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,

00:59:45.718 --> 00:59:48.187
it'll somehow
make you funny.

00:59:48.254 --> 00:59:50.289
Check out
this joker.

00:59:54.827 --> 00:59:56.295
Oh, my God.

00:59:56.362 --> 01:00:00.199
I
hated school as a kid.

01:00:00.266 --> 01:00:03.369
But my mother
would always say,

01:00:03.436 --> 01:00:05.038
"You should enjoy it.

01:00:05.104 --> 01:00:08.041
One day,
you'll have to work for a living."

01:00:08.107 --> 01:00:09.442
"No, I won't, Ma.

01:00:09.508 --> 01:00:11.277
I'm gonna be
a comedian."

01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:19.619
You shoulda
listened to your mother.

01:00:21.821 --> 01:00:23.756
Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.

01:00:23.823 --> 01:00:26.959
All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.

01:00:27.027 --> 01:00:28.661
It's funny,

01:00:28.728 --> 01:00:30.896
when I was
a little boy

01:00:30.963 --> 01:00:34.101
and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,

01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:36.268
everyone laughed at me.

01:00:36.335 --> 01:00:39.372
Well, no one's
laughing now.

01:00:42.575 --> 01:00:44.744
You can say
that again, pal.

01:00:50.117 --> 01:00:53.053
All right,
we got a great show for you tonight.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.522
Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,

01:00:56.589 --> 01:01:00.660
and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.

01:01:06.232 --> 01:01:08.934
As tensions
mount around the metro area,

01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:12.738
Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.

01:01:12.805 --> 01:01:14.540
City services
have been affected,

01:01:14.607 --> 01:01:16.609
and some businesses
have decided

01:01:16.676 --> 01:01:19.578
to remain closed
amid the unrest.

01:01:19.645 --> 01:01:22.381
Chuck Stevens
filed this report.

01:01:22.448 --> 01:01:23.916
The anger and resentment

01:01:23.983 --> 01:01:25.184
that's been building
in the city for weeks

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:27.087
seems close to exploding.

01:01:27.154 --> 01:01:29.388
Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,

01:01:29.455 --> 01:01:31.024
took to the streets today

01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:32.558
in one of several
planned demonstrations

01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:34.326
taking on
the city's elite,

01:01:34.393 --> 01:01:35.995
including a massive rally
outside

01:01:36.063 --> 01:01:38.664
tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.

01:01:38.731 --> 01:01:40.399
What's
the point of all this?

01:01:40.466 --> 01:01:42.334
- the rich.
- Thomas Wayne.

01:01:42.401 --> 01:01:44.104
That's what this whole
thing is about.

01:01:44.171 --> 01:01:45.938
the whole system.

01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:47.273
Wayne,
who recently announced

01:01:47.339 --> 01:01:48.607
he is running for mayor,

01:01:48.674 --> 01:01:50.476
will be attending
the benefit.

01:01:50.543 --> 01:01:52.611
You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne

01:01:52.678 --> 01:01:54.081
who first referred to

01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:56.949
many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."

01:01:57.017 --> 01:02:00.286
Today, he offered little
in the way of an apology.

01:02:00.352 --> 01:02:01.754
Well, what
I will say is,

01:02:01.821 --> 01:02:03.190
there's something wrong
with those people.

01:02:03.255 --> 01:02:04.623
I am here
to help them.

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:05.958
I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,

01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.393
help make
their lives better.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.295
That is why
I'm running.

01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:11.263
And they may not realize
it, but I'm their only hope.

01:02:26.879 --> 01:02:29.749
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

01:02:29.815 --> 01:02:32.718
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:14.480
Can I help you, pal?

01:05:16.482 --> 01:05:18.385
I don't know
what to say.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.157
Do you want an
autograph or something?

01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:25.424
No.

01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:32.965
My name is Arthur.

01:05:34.433 --> 01:05:36.136
Penny Fleck
is my mother.

01:05:37.436 --> 01:05:39.239
Jesus.

01:05:39.306 --> 01:05:41.207
You're the guy that came
to my house yesterday.

01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:44.476
Yes.

01:05:44.543 --> 01:05:46.512
I'm sorry
I just showed up.

01:05:46.578 --> 01:05:48.148
But my mother
told me everything,

01:05:48.214 --> 01:05:49.815
and I had
to talk to you.

01:05:49.882 --> 01:05:52.451
Look, pal,
I'm not your father.

01:05:52.518 --> 01:05:54.087
What's wrong with you?

01:05:55.621 --> 01:05:57.456
Look at us.

01:05:58.657 --> 01:06:00.126
I think you are.

01:06:00.193 --> 01:06:01.760
Well, that's impossible

01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:03.029
because you're adopted,

01:06:03.096 --> 01:06:04.797
and I never slept with
your mother.

01:06:04.863 --> 01:06:05.931
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

01:06:05.998 --> 01:06:07.499
- Money?
- No, I don't...

01:06:07.566 --> 01:06:08.734
I wasn't adopted.

01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:10.903
Jesus.
She never told you?

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.538
Told me what?

01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:15.908
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

01:06:15.975 --> 01:06:17.509
That's not true.

01:06:17.576 --> 01:06:18.811
Why are you
saying that?

01:06:18.877 --> 01:06:19.745
Then she was arrested
and committed

01:06:19.812 --> 01:06:20.980
to Arkham State Hospital,

01:06:21.047 --> 01:06:22.614
when you were
just a little boy.

01:06:22.681 --> 01:06:23.882
Why are you
saying this?

01:06:23.949 --> 01:06:25.584
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

01:06:25.651 --> 01:06:26.952
I know
it seems strange.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.754
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

01:06:28.821 --> 01:06:30.556
I don't know why
everyone is so rude.

01:06:30.622 --> 01:06:31.857
I don't know
why you are.

01:06:31.924 --> 01:06:33.393
I don't want
anything from you.

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.894
Maybe a little bit of
warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!

01:06:35.961 --> 01:06:38.231
How about just a little
bit of fucking decency?

01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:39.665
What is it
with you people?

01:06:39.732 --> 01:06:41.967
You say that stuff
about my mother.

01:06:42.035 --> 01:06:43.336
She's crazy.

01:06:43.403 --> 01:06:45.671
She's...

01:06:52.945 --> 01:06:54.646
You think
this is funny?

01:06:55.948 --> 01:06:59.285
Dad, it's me.
Come on.

01:07:01.954 --> 01:07:03.189
Touch
my son again,

01:07:03.256 --> 01:07:04.757
I'll fucking kill you.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:27.213
Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.615
We met the other night
at Gotham General.

01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:32.185
My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.

01:07:32.252 --> 01:07:35.255
We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.

01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:37.390
Please give me a call
when you get this message.

01:07:37.457 --> 01:07:39.459
Again, Detective Garrity,

01:07:39.526 --> 01:07:43.729
and my number
is 212... 99.

01:08:26.372 --> 01:08:28.508
This message is
for Arthur Fleck.

01:08:28.575 --> 01:08:30.143
My name
is Shirley Woods.

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:32.611
I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.

01:08:32.678 --> 01:08:34.080
I don't know
if you're aware,

01:08:34.147 --> 01:08:35.448
but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up

01:08:35.515 --> 01:08:37.417
on the show recently,

01:08:37.484 --> 01:08:39.785
and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.

01:08:39.852 --> 01:08:42.621
Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...

01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:48.094
Who is this?

01:08:48.161 --> 01:08:49.928
Oh, hi,
this is Shirley Woods.

01:08:49.995 --> 01:08:53.099
I'm the show booker from
Live with Murray Franklin.

01:08:53.166 --> 01:08:54.200
Is this Arthur?

01:08:56.202 --> 01:08:57.470
Yes.

01:08:57.537 --> 01:08:59.339
Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,

01:08:59.405 --> 01:09:01.441
we've gotten a lot of
calls about your clip.

01:09:01.508 --> 01:09:03.176
Amazing responses.

01:09:03.243 --> 01:09:05.445
And Murray asked if I
would reach out to you

01:09:05.512 --> 01:09:07.413
to see if you would
come on as his guest.

01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:15.821
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

01:09:15.888 --> 01:09:17.656
Yeah.
Isn't that great?

01:09:17.723 --> 01:09:21.528
He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?

01:09:21.594 --> 01:09:23.929
That sound good
to you?

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:30.103
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:32.038
Can we set up a date right now?

01:09:32.105 --> 01:09:34.073
Are you available
next Thursday?

01:10:26.659 --> 01:10:28.261
Hey.

01:10:28.328 --> 01:10:31.364
Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:33.600
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

01:10:33.666 --> 01:10:37.070
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:40.406
Can I ask you
a question?

01:10:40.473 --> 01:10:42.041
Sure.

01:10:42.108 --> 01:10:47.046
How does someone
wind up in here?

01:10:47.113 --> 01:10:51.351
Have they all,
all the people committed crimes?

01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:53.019
Well, yeah, some have.

01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:56.055
You know,
some are just crazy.

01:10:56.122 --> 01:10:58.757
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

01:10:58.824 --> 01:11:00.293
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.495
Don't know what to do, you know?

01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:06.299
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

01:11:06.366 --> 01:11:10.603
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:14.707
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

01:11:14.773 --> 01:11:18.877
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

01:11:19.945 --> 01:11:21.147
What's that?

01:11:22.382 --> 01:11:25.884
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:31.424
You know
what I'm talking about,

01:11:31.491 --> 01:11:36.462
it's so hard to just try
and be happy all the time.

01:11:38.531 --> 01:11:41.034
Hey, listen, man.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.669
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

01:11:42.735 --> 01:11:44.203
Like a clerk,
you know.

01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:46.139
All I do
is file paperwork.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.874
I don't know
what to tell you.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.842
But you should
see somebody.

01:11:50.909 --> 01:11:52.111
You know,
they got programs,

01:11:52.178 --> 01:11:54.880
city services,
stuff like that.

01:11:54.946 --> 01:11:56.316
Oh, yeah.

01:11:56.382 --> 01:11:58.084
They cut all those.

01:12:03.022 --> 01:12:05.091
All right, here it is. Fleck.

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:07.959
Penny Fleck.
Let's see.

01:12:08.027 --> 01:12:13.066
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

01:12:13.132 --> 01:12:17.236
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

01:12:17.303 --> 01:12:21.274
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:23.109
"Was found guilty
of endangering

01:12:23.176 --> 01:12:26.912
the welfare
of her own child."

01:12:34.953 --> 01:12:36.155
What?

01:12:39.292 --> 01:12:41.060
You said
she's your mother.

01:12:45.832 --> 01:12:47.567
Uh...

01:12:47.633 --> 01:12:49.669
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

01:12:49.736 --> 01:12:52.839
you know,
without proper forms.

01:12:52.904 --> 01:12:55.208
I could
get in trouble.

01:12:55.274 --> 01:12:57.577
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

01:12:57.643 --> 01:12:59.278
that'll be much easier,

01:12:59.345 --> 01:13:01.880
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

01:13:01.947 --> 01:13:03.149
I'm sorry.

01:13:07.086 --> 01:13:09.856
No, man! Shit!

01:13:09.921 --> 01:13:12.024
Come on, man.
Give it...

01:13:12.759 --> 01:13:15.194
Hey! Hey!

01:14:12.951 --> 01:14:16.689
We went over this, Penny.
You adopted him.

01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:19.192
We have all the
paperwork right here.

01:14:19.258 --> 01:14:21.561
That's not true.

01:14:21.627 --> 01:14:24.030
Thomas had that
all made up,

01:14:24.096 --> 01:14:27.066
so it stayed
our secret.

01:14:28.534 --> 01:14:31.704
You also
stood by

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:33.039
while one
of your boyfriends

01:14:33.105 --> 01:14:36.676
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

01:14:37.976 --> 01:14:39.178
and battered you.

01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:00.666
Penny,

01:15:00.733 --> 01:15:04.704
your son was found
tied to a radiator

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:07.173
in your filthy apartment.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.909
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

01:15:09.976 --> 01:15:11.978
and severe trauma
to his head.

01:15:13.913 --> 01:15:16.549
I
never heard him cry.

01:15:16.616 --> 01:15:20.386
He's always been such
a happy little boy.

01:17:21.273 --> 01:17:22.808
It's time
for bed.

01:17:26.212 --> 01:17:27.913
Oh, my God!

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.182
What are you doing in here?

01:17:32.351 --> 01:17:34.453
You're in the
wrong apartment.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.162
Your name's Arthur, right?

01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:44.597
You live
down the hall.

01:17:47.566 --> 01:17:49.602
I really
need you to leave.

01:17:53.639 --> 01:17:56.809
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

01:18:01.914 --> 01:18:03.182
Please.

01:18:05.718 --> 01:18:07.920
I had a bad day.

01:18:10.589 --> 01:18:13.392
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

01:19:39.411 --> 01:19:41.347
Shut up!

01:20:00.332 --> 01:20:01.867
Hey, Penny.

01:20:04.237 --> 01:20:05.704
Penny Fleck.

01:20:13.646 --> 01:20:15.714
I always hated
that name.

01:20:19.019 --> 01:20:21.353
You know how you used to tell me

01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:25.891
that my laugh
was a condition?

01:20:27.127 --> 01:20:29.595
That there was
something wrong with me?

01:20:32.464 --> 01:20:33.833
There isn't.

01:20:36.535 --> 01:20:38.604
That's the real me.

01:20:38.671 --> 01:20:40.472
Happy.

01:20:42.441 --> 01:20:45.011
Happy. Hmm.

01:20:48.281 --> 01:20:50.916
I haven't been happy

01:20:50.983 --> 01:20:53.586
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

01:21:00.359 --> 01:21:01.894
You know
what's funny?

01:21:04.496 --> 01:21:06.532
You know what really
makes me laugh?

01:21:08.634 --> 01:21:11.370
I used to think that my
life was a tragedy...

01:21:12.972 --> 01:21:15.041
...but now I realize

01:21:15.108 --> 01:21:16.775
it's a fucking comedy.

01:22:27.213 --> 01:22:28.681
A very fine actor.

01:22:28.747 --> 01:22:31.550
He's got a new movie
called American Playboy

01:22:31.617 --> 01:22:33.386
opening this week
across the country.

01:22:33.452 --> 01:22:35.521
Will you please
welcome a good friend

01:22:35.587 --> 01:22:37.656
of the show,
Mr. Ethan Chase.

01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:59.179
Good to see you, Ethan.
You're looking great, Ethan.

01:22:59.245 --> 01:23:01.014
Thank you very much.
You're looking good yourself.

01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:02.715
Ah,
can't complain.

01:23:02.781 --> 01:23:05.118
Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...

01:23:06.386 --> 01:23:07.820
Hey, Murray.

01:23:07.886 --> 01:23:09.955
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

01:23:10.023 --> 01:23:12.524
It's been a lifelong
dream of mine.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.861
I'm nervous
right now.

01:23:17.364 --> 01:23:19.698
- You are?
- I am nervous.

01:23:19.765 --> 01:23:21.967
Hey, Murray.
I've been on...

01:23:34.747 --> 01:23:36.515
I'm sorry.
What's that?

01:23:37.616 --> 01:23:39.651
Oh, that's
very funny, Murray.

01:23:40.686 --> 01:23:42.888
You know,
I'm also a comedian.

01:23:42.955 --> 01:23:44.391
Would you like
to hear a joke?

01:23:45.557 --> 01:23:48.261
Yeah?
All of you?

01:23:48.328 --> 01:23:49.528
Okay.

01:23:52.365 --> 01:23:53.433
Knock...

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:54.800
Knock, knock.

01:24:08.515 --> 01:24:09.948
Knock, knock.

01:26:07.233 --> 01:26:08.301
Coming.

01:26:19.379 --> 01:26:20.779
Hey, Arthur.

01:26:20.846 --> 01:26:22.048
How's it going?

01:26:22.848 --> 01:26:24.651
Oh, hey, guys.

01:26:24.716 --> 01:26:26.319
Come on in.

01:26:26.386 --> 01:26:27.686
Did you get
a new gig?

01:26:28.254 --> 01:26:29.721
No.

01:26:29.788 --> 01:26:33.092
Oh, you must be going down
to that rally at City Hall.

01:26:33.159 --> 01:26:34.960
I hear
it's gonna be nuts.

01:26:35.028 --> 01:26:36.895
Oh, is that today?

01:26:37.463 --> 01:26:39.132
Yeah.

01:26:39.199 --> 01:26:40.933
What's with
the makeup then?

01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:43.769
My mom died.

01:26:43.835 --> 01:26:45.205
I'm celebrating.

01:26:45.938 --> 01:26:47.006
Right. We heard.

01:26:47.073 --> 01:26:48.675
That's why
we came by.

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:51.578
We figured, you know,
you could use some cheering up.

01:26:51.644 --> 01:26:53.413
Aw, that's sweet.

01:26:53.479 --> 01:26:56.949
But, no, I feel good.

01:26:57.016 --> 01:26:58.784
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:00.752
I feel
a lot better now.

01:27:02.655 --> 01:27:05.258
Oh, okay.
Good for you.

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:10.129
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

01:27:10.196 --> 01:27:13.266
but the cops have been
coming around the shop,

01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:17.303
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:19.405
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

01:27:21.174 --> 01:27:24.277
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

01:27:24.344 --> 01:27:27.146
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

01:27:32.784 --> 01:27:34.053
Anyway, um,

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.191
Hoyt said that
they talked to you,

01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:39.692
and now
they're looking for me,

01:27:39.758 --> 01:27:41.294
and I just wanna know
what you said.

01:27:41.361 --> 01:27:43.162
Make sure
our stories line up.

01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:46.132
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

01:27:46.199 --> 01:27:48.001
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

01:27:48.067 --> 01:27:50.203
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

01:27:55.642 --> 01:27:57.110
Arthur!

01:27:57.176 --> 01:27:58.844
No!

01:27:59.911 --> 01:28:01.114
What?

01:28:02.382 --> 01:28:03.383
No!

01:28:11.124 --> 01:28:13.259
Why would
you do that, Arthur?

01:28:34.247 --> 01:28:36.582
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:38.184
Yeah.

01:28:39.252 --> 01:28:41.421
I'm gonna be
on tonight.

01:28:45.325 --> 01:28:47.327
It fucking crazy, innit?

01:28:47.393 --> 01:28:49.262
Me on the telly.

01:28:51.097 --> 01:28:53.266
What the fuck, Arthur?

01:28:54.467 --> 01:28:55.535
What?

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.008
It's okay, Gary.

01:29:02.075 --> 01:29:03.409
You can go.

01:29:05.745 --> 01:29:07.447
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

01:29:10.416 --> 01:29:11.917
Oh!

01:29:11.983 --> 01:29:14.253
Don't look.
Just go.

01:29:26.699 --> 01:29:27.899
Fuck.

01:29:32.938 --> 01:29:34.340
Hey, Arthur?

01:29:34.407 --> 01:29:36.309
Yeah?

01:29:36.376 --> 01:29:39.112
Arthur,
can you get the lock?

01:29:42.281 --> 01:29:43.583
Shit.

01:29:43.649 --> 01:29:45.218
Sorry, Gary.

01:29:56.028 --> 01:29:57.296
Gary?

01:29:57.363 --> 01:29:58.364
Yeah.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.469
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

01:30:05.538 --> 01:30:06.905
Skedaddle.

01:31:33.893 --> 01:31:35.428
Hey, Arthur!

01:31:35.495 --> 01:31:36.929
We need to talk.

01:31:36.995 --> 01:31:38.097
Oh!

01:31:38.164 --> 01:31:40.366
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

01:31:45.705 --> 01:31:46.772
Arthur!

01:31:49.242 --> 01:31:51.143
Watch it!
Out of the way!

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.281
Move!

01:31:57.083 --> 01:31:58.284
Arthur!

01:31:59.118 --> 01:32:00.520
Shit.

01:32:02.822 --> 01:32:04.090
Hey! Hey!

01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:12.131
Arthur, stop!

01:32:17.703 --> 01:32:18.704
Go! Go!

01:32:20.406 --> 01:32:22.708
Now
departing, O-Train, downtown.

01:32:24.477 --> 01:32:26.479
Stand clear of
the closing doors.

01:32:35.821 --> 01:32:38.524
Hold that train!
Hold it!

01:32:40.259 --> 01:32:42.461
Get out!
Get outta here!

01:32:42.528 --> 01:32:44.363
Next stop, Bedford Park.

01:32:58.744 --> 01:32:59.812
Masks off!

01:32:59.879 --> 01:33:01.380
Get your mask off!

01:33:02.049 --> 01:33:03.849
Signs down! Now!

01:33:12.992 --> 01:33:14.560
Police! Signs down!

01:33:15.695 --> 01:33:16.762
Signs down.

01:33:21.334 --> 01:33:22.668
What the fuck!

01:33:25.404 --> 01:33:26.772
Beat his ass!

01:33:33.346 --> 01:33:35.048
Stop fighting! Police!

01:33:35.114 --> 01:33:37.416
Police! Get down!

01:33:39.352 --> 01:33:41.654
Get down!
Get the fuck back!

01:33:42.722 --> 01:33:43.723
Police! Get down.

01:33:44.457 --> 01:33:45.758
Get the fuck down!

01:33:50.363 --> 01:33:52.865
Stay the fuck back!
Down!

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:57.570
What the...

01:34:00.873 --> 01:34:01.874
Arthur!

01:34:02.541 --> 01:34:03.509
Burke!

01:34:05.078 --> 01:34:06.646
Don't do it!

01:34:56.328 --> 01:34:57.797
Two officers on the train

01:34:57.863 --> 01:34:59.132
were violently confronted
by the crowd,

01:34:59.198 --> 01:35:00.633
and tonight are in serious

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.868
but stable condition
at Gotham Metropolitan.

01:35:02.935 --> 01:35:05.072
We're going live now to

01:35:05.138 --> 01:35:06.772
co-anchor Courtney Weathers,

01:35:06.839 --> 01:35:08.541
who's standing by outside
the Bedford Park Station,

01:35:08.607 --> 01:35:10.543
near where the shooting
took place.

01:35:10.609 --> 01:35:12.712
Courtney,
what's the scene there?

01:35:17.717 --> 01:35:18.751
Murray.

01:35:18.818 --> 01:35:20.419
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

01:35:20.486 --> 01:35:22.988
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

01:35:24.057 --> 01:35:25.424
Thank you, Murray.

01:35:26.392 --> 01:35:28.527
I feel like
I know you.

01:35:28.594 --> 01:35:30.730
I've been
watching you forever.

01:35:30.796 --> 01:35:31.964
Thank you.

01:35:32.032 --> 01:35:33.399
What's with the face?

01:35:33.466 --> 01:35:35.634
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

01:35:35.701 --> 01:35:36.736
No.

01:35:36.802 --> 01:35:39.139
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

01:35:39.206 --> 01:35:41.108
I don't believe
in anything.

01:35:41.174 --> 01:35:43.076
I just thought it'd
be good for my act.

01:35:43.143 --> 01:35:44.744
For your act?
Didn't you hear

01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:46.345
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

01:35:46.412 --> 01:35:47.913
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.482
No, I hadn't heard.

01:35:49.548 --> 01:35:50.816
- Yeah.
- You see? This is

01:35:50.883 --> 01:35:52.351
what I'm telling you.
The audience is

01:35:52.418 --> 01:35:53.586
gonna go crazy
if you put this guy on.

01:35:53.652 --> 01:35:55.488
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

01:35:55.554 --> 01:35:58.290
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

01:35:58.357 --> 01:36:00.960
We're gonna go with it.

01:36:01.027 --> 01:36:02.428
Thank you, Murray.

01:36:02.495 --> 01:36:03.729
Couple rules, though.

01:36:03.796 --> 01:36:05.798
No cursing.
No off-color material.

01:36:05.865 --> 01:36:07.299
We do a clean show.

01:36:07.366 --> 01:36:08.567
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:36:08.634 --> 01:36:10.237
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

01:36:10.302 --> 01:36:11.370
I love Dr. Sally.

01:36:11.437 --> 01:36:12.805
Good, good.
Someone will

01:36:12.872 --> 01:36:15.175
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

01:36:15.242 --> 01:36:16.342
Good luck.

01:36:16.408 --> 01:36:17.610
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

01:36:18.577 --> 01:36:22.015
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

01:36:22.082 --> 01:36:23.682
When you
bring me out,

01:36:23.749 --> 01:36:25.718
can you
introduce me as Joker?

01:36:25.785 --> 01:36:27.987
What's wrong
with your real name?

01:36:28.054 --> 01:36:30.723
That's what you
called me on the show.

01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:31.957
A joker.

01:36:32.025 --> 01:36:33.260
Do you remember?

01:36:33.325 --> 01:36:35.195
- Did I?
- I don't know.

01:36:35.262 --> 01:36:37.797
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

01:36:37.863 --> 01:36:38.931
It's good.

01:36:38.998 --> 01:36:40.066
Thanks, Murray.

01:37:01.921 --> 01:37:03.522
I'll try it,
you know,

01:37:03.589 --> 01:37:05.292
but I'm not sure my
wife will let me do it.

01:37:06.659 --> 01:37:08.061
Maybe my next wife.

01:37:11.697 --> 01:37:13.566
You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.

01:37:13.632 --> 01:37:15.868
I'm pretty sure this
guy could use a doctor.

01:37:15.935 --> 01:37:17.170
Oh!

01:37:17.237 --> 01:37:18.838
Does he have
sexual problems?

01:37:18.904 --> 01:37:21.174
Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

01:37:22.875 --> 01:37:25.178
All right, Bobby,
let's show that clip one last time.

01:37:31.184 --> 01:37:34.486
I hated
school as a kid.

01:37:35.921 --> 01:37:39.025
But my mother
would always say,

01:37:39.092 --> 01:37:40.893
"You should enjoy it.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.762
One day,
you'll have to work for a living."

01:37:43.829 --> 01:37:44.964
"No, I won't, Ma.

01:37:45.031 --> 01:37:47.167
I'm gonna be
a comedian."

01:37:53.206 --> 01:37:56.942
Okay. You may...

01:37:57.010 --> 01:38:00.280
You may have seen that
clip of our next guest.

01:38:00.347 --> 01:38:03.116
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

01:38:03.183 --> 01:38:04.583
that we're
all heartbroken

01:38:04.650 --> 01:38:06.685
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

01:38:06.752 --> 01:38:09.055
But this is how he
wanted to come out,

01:38:09.122 --> 01:38:12.558
and honestly,
I think we could all use a good laugh.

01:38:12.625 --> 01:38:15.861
So, please welcome, Joker.

01:38:57.469 --> 01:38:58.971
Are you
all right, Doctor?

01:39:02.641 --> 01:39:05.211
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:12.851
You okay?

01:39:15.521 --> 01:39:16.922
Yeah.

01:39:16.989 --> 01:39:19.959
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

01:39:21.727 --> 01:39:23.595
Well, that makes
one of us.

01:39:30.469 --> 01:39:32.671
So, can you tell us
about this look?

01:39:32.738 --> 01:39:34.374
When we spoke earlier,

01:39:34.441 --> 01:39:36.309
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

01:39:36.376 --> 01:39:37.609
Is that right?

01:39:37.676 --> 01:39:39.112
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

01:39:39.179 --> 01:39:41.880
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

01:39:41.947 --> 01:39:44.150
And how's that going for you?

01:39:52.025 --> 01:39:53.959
So, I know
you're a comedian.

01:39:54.027 --> 01:39:55.894
You been working on
any new material?

01:39:55.961 --> 01:39:57.263
You wanna
tell us a joke?

01:40:03.036 --> 01:40:04.037
Yeah?

01:40:06.172 --> 01:40:07.173
Okay.

01:40:13.213 --> 01:40:14.913
He's got a book.

01:40:15.647 --> 01:40:17.217
A book of jokes.

01:40:26.892 --> 01:40:28.660
Take your time.
We got all night.

01:40:34.434 --> 01:40:36.869
Okay, okay.
Here's one.

01:40:39.772 --> 01:40:42.442
Knock, knock.

01:40:42.509 --> 01:40:43.976
And you had to
look that up?

01:40:50.883 --> 01:40:52.785
I want to
get it right.

01:40:54.454 --> 01:40:56.156
Knock, knock.

01:40:56.222 --> 01:40:57.823
Who's there?

01:40:58.991 --> 01:41:00.592
It's the police, ma'am.

01:41:00.659 --> 01:41:02.594
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

01:41:02.661 --> 01:41:05.564
He's dead.

01:41:06.932 --> 01:41:08.667
Oh, no, no, no.

01:41:08.734 --> 01:41:10.602
No, you cannot
joke about that.

01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:12.505
Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.

01:41:12.571 --> 01:41:15.741
That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.

01:41:15.808 --> 01:41:18.111
Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:41:18.178 --> 01:41:22.681
It's just, you know,
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:26.219
Ever since

01:41:28.455 --> 01:41:31.024
I killed those three
Wall Street guys.

01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:39.598
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.

01:41:40.799 --> 01:41:42.768
There is
no punch line.

01:41:43.902 --> 01:41:46.005
It's not a joke.

01:41:50.543 --> 01:41:51.677
You're serious,
aren't you?

01:41:51.743 --> 01:41:52.978
You're telling us
you killed

01:41:53.046 --> 01:41:54.180
those three young men
on the subway?

01:41:54.247 --> 01:41:55.181
Mmm-hmm.

01:41:55.248 --> 01:41:57.016
And why should
we believe you?

01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:59.252
I got nothing
left to lose.

01:42:01.054 --> 01:42:03.289
Nothing can
hurt me anymore.

01:42:06.226 --> 01:42:09.728
My life is
nothing but a comedy.

01:42:12.831 --> 01:42:14.167
Well, let me
get this straight,

01:42:14.234 --> 01:42:16.336
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:18.338
I do.

01:42:18.404 --> 01:42:21.174
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

01:42:21.241 --> 01:42:23.642
Comedy is subjective,
Murray.

01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:25.545
Isn't that
what they say?

01:42:25.612 --> 01:42:27.480
All of you,

01:42:27.547 --> 01:42:30.083
the system
that knows so much,

01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:32.985
you decide
what's right or wrong.

01:42:33.052 --> 01:42:38.424
The same way that you
decide what's funny or not!

01:42:39.691 --> 01:42:41.227
Get him off!

01:42:41.294 --> 01:42:45.265
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

01:42:45.331 --> 01:42:46.899
that you did this to
start a movement,

01:42:46.965 --> 01:42:49.602
to become a symbol?

01:42:49.668 --> 01:42:51.171
Come on, Murray.

01:42:51.237 --> 01:42:52.572
Do I look like
the kind of clown

01:42:52.639 --> 01:42:54.174
that could
start a movement?

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.177
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

01:42:57.243 --> 01:42:59.912
Everybody is awful
these days.

01:42:59.978 --> 01:43:02.282
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

01:43:02.348 --> 01:43:04.217
Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.

01:43:04.284 --> 01:43:06.919
That's your defense for
killing three young men?

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.954
No.

01:43:09.022 --> 01:43:12.691
They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.

01:43:14.227 --> 01:43:18.331
Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?

01:43:18.398 --> 01:43:20.166
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

01:43:20.233 --> 01:43:21.800
you'd walk
right over me!

01:43:21.867 --> 01:43:24.037
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

01:43:24.103 --> 01:43:26.306
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

01:43:26.372 --> 01:43:28.074
went and cried about them on TV?

01:43:28.141 --> 01:43:30.443
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:32.312
Yes, I do.

01:43:32.378 --> 01:43:35.981
Have you seen what it's
like out there, Murray?

01:43:36.049 --> 01:43:39.152
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

01:43:39.219 --> 01:43:43.356
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

01:43:43.423 --> 01:43:45.425
Nobody's civil anymore.

01:43:45.491 --> 01:43:49.928
Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.

01:43:49.995 --> 01:43:52.831
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

01:43:52.898 --> 01:43:54.933
what it's like to be
someone like me?

01:43:55.001 --> 01:43:57.869
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

01:43:57.936 --> 01:44:00.039
They think that
we'll just sit there

01:44:00.106 --> 01:44:02.774
and take it,
like good little boys!

01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:05.178
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

01:44:05.245 --> 01:44:06.613
You finished?

01:44:06.679 --> 01:44:09.215
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

01:44:09.282 --> 01:44:10.916
You sound like
you're making excuses

01:44:10.983 --> 01:44:12.385
for killing
those young men.

01:44:12.452 --> 01:44:14.520
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

01:44:14.587 --> 01:44:16.122
not everyone is awful.

01:44:18.157 --> 01:44:19.592
You're awful, Murray.

01:44:19.659 --> 01:44:21.628
Me? I'm awful?

01:44:21.694 --> 01:44:23.496
Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?

01:44:25.632 --> 01:44:27.200
Playing my video.

01:44:28.334 --> 01:44:31.237
Inviting me
on this show.

01:44:31.304 --> 01:44:34.707
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

01:44:34.773 --> 01:44:36.609
You're just like
the rest of them.

01:44:36.676 --> 01:44:38.678
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

01:44:38.745 --> 01:44:41.681
Look what happened,
because of what you did. What it led to.

01:44:41.748 --> 01:44:43.383
There are riots
out there.

01:44:43.449 --> 01:44:45.018
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

01:44:45.084 --> 01:44:46.452
and you're laughing.

01:44:46.519 --> 01:44:47.986
You're laughing.

01:44:48.054 --> 01:44:50.590
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

01:44:50.657 --> 01:44:52.225
I know.

01:44:54.494 --> 01:44:56.062
How about another joke, Murray?

01:44:56.129 --> 01:44:57.764
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

01:44:57.863 --> 01:44:59.065
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

01:44:59.132 --> 01:45:01.833
...when you cross
a mentally-ill loner

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:04.237
with a society
that abandons him

01:45:04.304 --> 01:45:05.605
and treats him
like trash?

01:45:05.672 --> 01:45:07.140
Call the police, Gene!

01:45:07.206 --> 01:45:08.374
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

01:45:08.441 --> 01:45:10.109
You get what you
fucking deserve!

01:45:46.346 --> 01:45:49.948
Good night.
And always remember, that's...

01:45:54.886 --> 01:45:56.289
Breaking news.

01:45:56.356 --> 01:45:58.725
Popular TV talk show host,
Murray Franklin

01:45:58.791 --> 01:46:01.160
was shot dead tonight on the
live telecast of his program.

01:46:01.227 --> 01:46:03.463
The man who was
introduced by Franklin

01:46:03.529 --> 01:46:06.499
as "Joker" is
currently under arrest.

01:46:06.566 --> 01:46:09.302
Police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio.

01:46:11.170 --> 01:46:13.539
...merely just a punch
line to a joke...

01:46:13.606 --> 01:46:15.341
You get what
you deserve!

01:46:15.408 --> 01:46:16.642
Looting and rioting

01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:18.177
have intensified here...

01:46:18.244 --> 01:46:19.746
...rioting
throughout the city.

01:46:19.812 --> 01:46:21.147
...with a society
that abandons him

01:46:21.214 --> 01:46:22.548
and treats him
like trash?

01:46:22.615 --> 01:46:24.317
This mob of clowns...

01:46:24.384 --> 01:46:25.718
...many
wearing clown masks.

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.489
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

01:46:29.555 --> 01:46:31.157
- you'd walk right over me.
- To all of

01:46:31.224 --> 01:46:32.658
those who have been
ignored by the system.

01:46:32.725 --> 01:46:34.460
And always remember,
that's life!

01:46:34.527 --> 01:46:35.828
And as you see,
Gotham is burning.

01:47:30.349 --> 01:47:32.785
Stop laughing, you freak!
This isn't funny.

01:47:32.852 --> 01:47:34.253
Yeah,
the whole fucking city's on fire

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.422
'cause of
what you did.

01:47:36.489 --> 01:47:38.925
All units,
fire reported, north of alley.

01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:40.626
Code Four
for medical.

01:47:41.127 --> 01:47:42.695
I know.

01:47:44.096 --> 01:47:46.365
Isn't it beautiful?

01:49:28.701 --> 01:49:30.169
Go over there.

01:49:47.887 --> 01:49:49.689
Hey, Wayne.

01:49:49.755 --> 01:49:51.824
You get what you
fucking deserve.

01:49:51.891 --> 01:49:53.259
No! Pal!

01:50:33.633 --> 01:50:35.901
Come on,
get up!

01:50:35.968 --> 01:50:37.970
Come on,
man, get up.

01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:19.398
What's so funny?

01:53:23.203 --> 01:53:24.870
Just thinking
of a joke.

01:53:43.823 --> 01:53:46.026
Do you want
to tell it to me?

01:53:52.165 --> 01:53:53.966
You wouldn't get it.
